## Academic Bio

I am an assistant professor in the School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Georgia. My research concentrates on education finance and policy at state and local levels of government. I enjoy teaching courses in quantitative methods, public budgeting and finance, program evaluation, and policy analysis. Any application of these subjects to education is a plus, but I find many policy topics interesting.

## A Related Interest

Exploring data and software to make analyses more efficient and insightful is a favorite pastime of mine. Along with teaching, this is easily my biggest obstacle to writing papers. I was raised on Stata but began the conversion to R shortly before arriving to UGA. I appreciate both programs, but R has opened up a whole new world that I regret not learning sooner. I am trying to catch up on lost time.
