## Academic

I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Georgia. My research concentrates on education finance and policy at state and local levels of government. I enjoy teaching courses in quantitative methods, public budgeting and finance, program evaluation, and policy analysis. Any application of these subjects to education is a plus, but I find many policy topics interesting.
