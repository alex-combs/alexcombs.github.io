## Academic Bio

I am an assistant professor in the School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Georgia. My research concentrates on education finance and policy at state and local levels of government. I enjoy teaching courses in quantitative methods, public budgeting and finance, program evaluation, and policy analysis. Any application of these subjects to education is a plus, but I find many policy topics interesting.

## Related Interest

Exploring data and software to make analyses more efficient and insightful is a favorite pastime of mine. I was raised on Stata but began the conversion to R shortly before arriving to UGA. I appreciate both programs, but R has opened up a world of data science resources that I regret not learning about sooner. I am catching up on lost time.

## Previous Employment

Prior to arriving at UGA, I served a one-year appointment as an instructor and research analyst with the Martin School of Public Policy and Administration at the University of Kentucky. I taught courses in strategic planning and program evaluation for the Martin School's MPA and MPP programs. I also worked with the [Kentucky Center for Statistics](https://kystats.ky.gov) on a project to explore relationships between opioid abuse and educational outcomes.

Before starting graduate school, I worked for Sigma Nu Fraternity, Inc. as a consultant and assistant director. Given the polarized views on social fraternities and sororities, I see a variety of reactions when I mention this to others.
