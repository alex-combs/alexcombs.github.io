I am an assistant professor in the School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Georgia. I earned my PhD from the Martin School of Public Policy and Administration at the University of Kentucky. I research state and local budgeting and finance in the area of education. Specifically, I focus on the impact that various features of property and sales taxes have on K-12 school finances and how state higher education subsidies impact college expenditures and enrollment. I teach undergraduate and graduate courses in public budgeting, quantitative methods, policy analysis, education finance, and nonprofit management.
