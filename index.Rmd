I am an assistant professor in the School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Georgia. I earned my PhD from the Martin School of Public Policy and Administration at the University of Kentucky. My research involves state and local government finance and education. I focus on the impact of property taxes and local sales taxes on K-12 school finance and how state postsecondary subsidies affect college expenditures. I teach undergraduate courses in policy analysis and nonprofit management, as well as graduate courses in public budgeting, quantitative methods, and education finance.
