I am an assistant professor in the School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Georgia. I earned my Ph.D. from the Martin School of Public Policy and Administration at the University of Kentucky. I research state and local budgeting and finance in the area of education. I tend to study how mechanisms of property and sales taxes impact the school resources as well as the state budgeting allocations between different types of higher education subsidies. I teach courses in public budgeting, quantitative methods, policy analysis, education finance, and nonprofit management.
