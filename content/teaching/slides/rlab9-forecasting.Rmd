# Learning objectives

By the end of this lab, you will have learned how to...

- Convert a dataset to a time series dataset in R
- Explore time series for patterns
- Execute some simple forecasting models like naive, average, and (seasonal) trend
- Execute exponential smoothing
- Exucute a regression-adjusted forecast
- Evaluate and choose between forecast models

# Steps of forecasting

1. Preliminary/exploratory analysis
2. Choosing and fitting models
3. Using and evaluating a forecasting model

# Creating a TS object

- Before starting prelim analysis, we need to prep data
- The below code converts the `voting` data to a new TS object.

```{r}
voting_ts <- ts(voting[,-1], start = 1912, end = 2016, frequency = 0.25)
```

5. Convert the `sales` data to a new TS object.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
sales_ts <- 
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
sales_ts <- ts(sales[,-1], start = 1981, end = 2005, frequency = 4)
```
