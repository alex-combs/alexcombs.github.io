# Outline

- Principles of good and bad visualization

- Qualities of human perception

---
# Exploratory vs. explanatory

- Like most applications in statistics, visualizations can either explore or explain

# Keep in mind while there are general guidelines to good visualization, there remains some subjectivity.

---
# Qualities of good viz

1. Properly chosen format and design

2. Use words, numbers, and drawing together

3. Display an accessible complexity of detail

4. Avoid content-free decoration--chart junk

5. Maximize data-to-ink ratio

---
# Qualities of bad viz

1. Bad taste, unnecessary ink

2. Bad data

3. Bad perspective

---
# Bad taste?
