# Outline



- Overview of research design
  - Counterfactual
  - Internal validity
  - External validity
  - Experimental, quasi-experimental, non-experimental

- Criteria to claim that `\(x\)` *causes* a change in `\(y\)`

- Systematic process to identify omitted variable bias (endogeneity) and what can be done about it

---
# Potential outcomes

- A causal effect is a comparison of two potential outcomes

  - The outcome that we observe in the presence of the event

  - **Counterfactual:** The outcome we would have observed had the event not happened

---
# Potential outcomes

- Half of the data we need to observe causation is missing

  - We observe the outcome for those who received some treatment

  - We observe the outcome for those who did not receive the treatment

- Cannot observe the outcome for the treated as if they had NOT been treated 

- Cannot observe the outcome for the untreated as if they HAD been treated

---
# The challenge of counterfactual

- All we can do is compare outcomes between observed groups (treated and untreated). This can take several forms.

--

- **Randomize** treatment so nothing else differs between treated and untreated groups

--
  
- **Quasi-experimental** methods that use a feature of the treatment that allows us to claim it is as good as randomized

--
  
- **Non-experimental:** Controlling for all the necessary variables to claim there is no relevant difference between treated and untreated (least credible)

---
# Credible Analysis

&lt;img src="lectures_files/credible.png" width="1304" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Internal validity

**Internal validity:** the credibility of the theoretical assumptions applied and the causal connection established between the cause (policy, program, treatment) and an effect

- Does a change in `\(x\)` cause a change in `\(y\)`?

- Is the estimate biased? Is our estimate systematically higher or lower than the truth?

---
# Internal validity

- A criminal justice nonprofit explores potential factors that affect the likelihood of recidivism 

`$$ReOffense = \beta_0 + \beta_1Age + \beta_2Sex + \epsilon$$`


|Variable  | Estimates|
|:---------|---------:|
|Intercept |     1.370|
|Age       |    -0.036|
|Sex       |     0.250|

- Internal validity concerns whether there is a credible theory why these factors would have an impact and if estimates are accurate or biased. If biased, to what extent does it limit our ability to make useful conclusions?

---
# Criteria for causation

1. Correlation between `\(x\)` and `\(y\)` -- as `\(x\)` changes, `\(y\)` must also tend to change

2. Temporal precedence -- `\(x\)` must occur before `\(y\)`

3. No plausible rival or alternative explanations -- no other variable `\(z\)` can influence the change in `\(y\)` we attribute to `\(x\)`

---
# Correlation between X and Y

- If you run a hypothesis test and the estimate is statistically significant (we haven't covered this yet), you have established credible non-random correlation 

- But many things correlate that share no causal relationship

---
# Temporal Precedence

- Cause must occur before its effect

- Easiest to claim for discrete events with a clear pre and post
  - Marijuana legalization on health outcomes
  - Child tax credit expansion on child poverty

--

- Without a clear pre and post period, harder to eliminate **reverse causality**
  - Crime rates and police funding
  - GDP and life expectancy

---
# No plausible alternative explanation

- No other variable `\(z\)` can influence the change in `\(y\)` we attribute to `\(x\)`

--

- Employment rate among those who participated in a job training program is 75% compared to 40% among those who did not participate.

--

- Conclusion: Job training programs increase the likelihood of employment by 35 percentage points. 

- Plausible alternatives?

# Directed Acyclical Graphs (DAGS)

---
# DAGS

- Visual representation of causal pathways

- Forces us to consider our assumptions

- Allows us to evaluate our model and our ability to claim causation, especially using a **non-experimental** approach

---
# Regression and DAGS

- Behind every regression is a DAG

`$$Happiness=\beta_0+\beta_1Age+\beta_2Income+\epsilon$$`

&lt;img src="lectures_files/dag15.png" width="843" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Backdoor path

&lt;img src="lectures_files/dag3.png" width="552" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- `\(Z\)` is a **confounder**

- Leads to **omitted variable bias** (OVB)

---
# Close the backdoor

- Our goal is to close all backdoor paths between `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)`

- Three ways to close a backdoor path

--

1. Control for the **confounder** in our regression

---
# Close the backdoor

&lt;img src="lectures_files/dag4.png" width="700" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

.pull-left[
`$$Y=\beta_0+\beta_1X+\epsilon$$`

- Backdoor open - OVB
]

.pull-right[
`$$Y=\beta_0+\beta_1X+\beta_2Z+\epsilon$$`

- Backdoor closed - No OVB
]

---
# Close the backdoor

- Three ways to close a backdoor path

1. Control for the **confounder**

--

2. Control for any variable along the backdoor path

---
# Close the backdoor

&lt;img src="lectures_files/dag4.2.png" width="447" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

.center[
`$$X \rightarrow Y$$`
`$$X \leftarrow Z \rightarrow K \rightarrow Y$$`
]

.pull-left[
`$$Y=\beta_0+\beta_1X+\epsilon$$`

- Backdoor open; OVB
]

.pull-right[
`$$Y=\beta_0+\beta_1X+\beta_2K+\epsilon$$`

- Backdoor closed/blocked; no OVB
]

---
# Close the backdoor

- Three ways to close a backdoor path

1. Control for the **confounder**

2. Control for any variable along the backdoor path

--

3. Identify a **collider** variable that closes the backdoor path

---
# Collider variable

&lt;img src="lectures_files/dag6.png" width="533" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- `\(Z\)` is a **collider** in this case

- Colliders close backdoors

---
# Close the backdoor

&lt;img src="lectures_files/dag5.png" width="351" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

.center[
`\(X \rightarrow Y\)`

`\(X \leftarrow Z \rightarrow K \leftarrow Y\)`
]

.pull-left[
`$$Y=\beta_0+\beta_1X+\epsilon$$`
`$$Y=\beta_0+\beta_1X+\beta_2Z+\epsilon$$`
`$$Y=\beta_0+\beta_1X+\beta_2Z+\beta_3K+\epsilon$$`
- All are fine; backdoor closed
]

.pull-right[
`$$Y=\beta_0+\beta_1X+\beta_2K+\epsilon$$`

- Backdoor now open; OVB

- Also known as **bad control**
]

---
# The error term and OVB

&lt;img src="lectures_files/dag8.png" width="796" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

.center[

`$$Y=\beta_0+\beta_1X+\epsilon$$`

]

- If true model was left DAG, our estimate `\(b_1\)` is *not* solely due to `\(X\)`, but rather unobserved factors contained in `\(\epsilon\)`

- Referred to as **endogeneity** or "X is endogenous"

---
# Error term and OVB

.center[
`$$Happiness=\beta_0+\beta_1Age+\beta_2Income+\epsilon$$`]

.pull-left[
&lt;img src="lectures_files/dag15.png" width="843" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

.pull-right[
- What variables might the error term contain?

- Do any of our omitted variables also affect age or income?
]

# Using DAGS

---
# Using DAGS

1. Begin with the direct path between `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)` based on your research question

2. Identify other factors that affect `\(X\)` and/or `\(Y\)`, adding them to the DAG accordingly

3. List all paths starting from `\(X\)` to `\(Y\)`

4. Identify any backdoor paths and determine how to close them

---
# Using DAGS

- Suppose we want to know if college, `\(C\)`, increases earnings, `\(Y\)`?

- `\(C \rightarrow Y\)`

`$$Y=\beta_0+\beta_1C+\epsilon$$`

--

- Now we should identify any other factors that affect earnings and/or going to college

- Suppose we identify three factors: 
  - Parent's education `\(PE\)` 
  - Family income `\(I\)` 
  - Natural aptitude of parents/child `\(A\)`

---
# Using DAGS

- Now we think of the relationships between all of our factors and draw the corresponding DAG

- Suppose we settle on the following DAG

&lt;img src="lectures_files/dag10.png" width="473" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- Next step is to list all paths we can trace between `\(C\)` and `\(Y\)`, drawing the arrows according to their direction in our diagram

---
# Using DAGS

&lt;img src="lectures_files/dag10.png" width="394" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

1. `\(C \rightarrow Y\)` (the causal effect of college on earnings)

--

2. `\(C \leftarrow I \rightarrow Y\)` (backdoor 1)

--

3. `\(C \leftarrow PE \rightarrow I \rightarrow Y\)` (backdoor 2)

--

4. `\(C \leftarrow A \rightarrow PE \rightarrow I \rightarrow Y\)` (backdoor3)

--

- Any colliders? No. We have three open backdoor paths. Systematic non-causal correlations between `\(C\)` and `\(Y\)`

---
# Using DAGS

1. `\(C \rightarrow Y\)` (the causal effect of college on earnings)
2. `\(C \leftarrow I \rightarrow Y\)` (backdoor 1)
3. `\(C \leftarrow PE \rightarrow I \rightarrow Y\)` (backdoor 2)
4. `\(C \leftarrow A \rightarrow PE \rightarrow I \rightarrow Y\)` (backdoor3)

- Next step is to identify the minimum set of control variables needed to close all backdoors.

--

- Controlling for family income `\(I\)` closes all three backdoors

.center[
`$$Y=\beta_0+\beta_1C+\beta_2I+\epsilon$$`
]

- If we believe this DAG, then we now have the causal effect of college on earnings.

---
# Assumptions &amp; alternatives

&lt;img src="lectures_files/dag10.png" width="394" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- Two key assumptions this DAG makes

--

1. Other than natural aptitude `\(A\)`, no other *unobserved* factors affect `\(C\)`

--

2. Natural aptitude does not directly affect earnings `\(Y\)`

---
# Assumptions &amp; alternatives

&lt;img src="lectures_files/dag11.png" width="389" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

.pull-left[
1. `\(C \rightarrow Y\)` 
2. `\(C \leftarrow I \rightarrow Y\)` 
3. `\(C \leftarrow PE \rightarrow I \rightarrow Y\)`
4. `\(C \leftarrow A \rightarrow PE \rightarrow I \rightarrow Y\)` 
5. `\(C \leftarrow A \rightarrow Y\)`
6. `\(C \leftarrow PE \leftarrow A \rightarrow Y\)`
7. `\(C \leftarrow I \leftarrow PE \leftarrow A \rightarrow Y\)`
]

.pull-right[

- Controlling for `\(I\)` closes 2, 3, 4, &amp; 7

- Controlling for `\(PE\)` closes 6

- Currently no way to close 5; omitted variable bias
]

---
# Direction of OVB

- Suppose you or someone else has identified an omitted variable that causes bias.

- All is not necessarily lost. Results may still be useful.

&lt;img src="lectures_files/dag_ovbdirect.png" width="292" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- If influence of `\(Z\)` is in same direction: bias is positive
- If influence of `\(Z\)` is in opposite directions: bias is negative

- Key question: Is the bias pushing my result toward 0 or away from 0?

---
# Recap

- Is my claim about the relationship between a cause and effect credible? Can I claim there is no OVB?

--

- If so, internally valid. Now we can consider **external validity**.

---
# External validity

- **External validity (generalizability):** can results be applied beyond the subjects or context included in the analysis?

--

- Are those in my sample representative of the population? Did the program select or recipients self-select in unrepresentative ways?

- Are there reasons to suspect location or time matter and results may not apply elsewhere or at later times?

--

- If you cannot claim sample represents population, possible you can claim sample represents a subset of the population that is larger than the sample.

- Example: Effect of job training on participants instead of any unemployed person. Known as **treatment on the treated**.

---
# Causal inference models

&lt;img src="lectures_files/dag14.png" width="468" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- Random assignment breaks any OVB from the error term

- Random assignment is often difficult to achieve in social sciences

- There are quasi-experimental regression techniques that arguably achieve the same break from the error term as if random
  - Difference-in-differences, regression discontinuity, instrumental variables, synthetic control, propensity score matching

# Supplemtary Slides: Collider Bias Revisited

---
# Collider bias

- Collider bias can occur in two ways:

- Controlling for a collider in our regression that opens a backdoor path

- Using a sample where observations are selected based on a collider variable

---
# Seeing collider bias












| Treatment| Outcome| Collider|
|---------:|-------:|--------:|
|         0|      99|      993|
|         0|     101|     1007|
|         1|     149|     1542|
|         0|      99|      996|

- Sample includes 2,500 observations

---
# Seeing Collider Bias

`$$Outcome=\beta_0 + \beta_1Treatment + \epsilon$$`

`$$Outcome=\beta_0 + \beta_1Treatment + \beta_2Collider + \epsilon$$`

- These data are made up in a way that the effect of Treatment, `\(\beta_1\)`, should equal 50.

- The collider does not affect the outcome or the treatment. The outcome and treatment affects the collider.

`$$Treatment \rightarrow Collider \leftarrow Outcome$$`

---
# Seeing collider bias


```r
valid &lt;- lm(Outcome ~ Treatment, data = collider_bias)
biased &lt;- lm(Outcome ~ Treatment + Collider, data = collider_bias)
```

.pull-left[

|term      | estimate|
|:---------|--------:|
|intercept |   100.01|
|Treatment |    49.93|
]

.pull-right[

|term      | estimate|
|:---------|--------:|
|intercept |     0.99|
|Treatment |    -4.45|
|Collider  |     0.10|
]

- Coefficient for `\(X\)` should be 50.

- Because `\(Treatment \rightarrow Collider \leftarrow Outcome\)`, controlling for Collider introduces bias

---
# Collider bias: bad sample

- Suppose a nonprofit that works with at-risk youth wants to understand the effect of school absences on grades. It only has access to data on its own clients.

- Suppose at-risk youth are identified by socioeconomic status, GPA, and absences

&lt;img src="lectures_files/dag13.png" width="385" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Collider bias (2) bad sample

`$$GPA = \beta_0 + \beta_1TotAbsences + \beta_2 SES + \epsilon$$`

&lt;img src="lectures_files/dag13.png" width="385" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

.pull-left[

1. `\(TA \rightarrow GPA\)`
2. `\(TA \leftarrow SES \rightarrow GPA\)`
3. `\(TA \rightarrow AtRisk \leftarrow GPA\)`
4. `\(TA \leftarrow SES \rightarrow AtRisk \leftarrow GPA\)`

]

.pull-right[

- Will our estimate `\(b_1\)` be unbiased?

- No. Because our sample is selected from `\(AtRisk\)`; same as controlling for it.

- Selection bias
]

---
# Seeing selection bias

`\(Absent \rightarrow AtRisk \leftarrow GPA\)`

- Suppose our sample only includes those at-risk

- But we want to estimate the effect of absences on GPA
