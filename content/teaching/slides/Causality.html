# Outline



- Overview of research design and key components
  - Counterfactual
  - Internal validity
  - External validity
  - Experimental, quasi-experimental, non-experimental

- Criteria to claim that `\(x\)` *causes* a change in `\(y\)`

- Systematic process to identify omitted variable bias (endogeneity) and what can be done about it

---
# Potential outcomes

- A causal effect is a comparison of two potential outcomes

--

- The outcome that we observe in the presence of the event

- The outcome that we would have observed had the event *not happened*

--

- What would have happened in this alternate reality is referred to as the **counterfactual**

---
# Potential outcomes

- Half of the data we need to *observe* causation is missing

- We observe the outcome for those who received some treatment

- We observe the outcome for those who did not receive the treatment

--

- Can never observe the outcome among the treated had they not received it or the untreated as if they had

---
# The challenge of counterfactual

- All we can do is compare outcomes between observed groups. This can take several forms.

--

- **Randomize** treatment so nothing else differs between treated and untreated groups

--
  
- Use **quasi-experimental** design that leverages some aspect of the treatment to claim it is *as if* randomized

--
  
- **Non-experimental:** No special design element; controlling for all the right variables to claim there is no spurious correlation

---
# Credible Analysis

&lt;img src="lectures_files/credible.png" width="1304" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Internal validity

**Internal validity:** the credibility of the theoretical assumptions applied and the causal connection established between the cause (policy, program, treatment) and an effect

- Does a change in `\(x\)` cause a change in `\(y\)`?

---
# Criteria for causation

1. Correlation between `\(x\)` and `\(y\)` -- as `\(x\)` changes, `\(y\)` must also tend to change

2. Temporal precedence -- `\(x\)` must occur before `\(y\)`

3. No plausible rival or alternative explanations -- no other variable `\(z\)` can influence the change in `\(y\)` we attribute to `\(x\)`

---
# Correlation between X and Y

- If you run a regression and the coefficient is statistically significant, you have established correlation that is unlikely random

- But many things correlate that share no causal relationship

---
# Temporal Precedence

- Easiest for discrete event or intervention

  - Medicaid expansion on health outcomes
  
  - Stimulus check on spending/saving
  
  - Job training program on employment outcomes

--
  
- More difficult with ongoing/continuous phenomena

  - Mask wearing and COVID spread
  
  - Macroeconomics
  
- Possible solution: Use `\(x\)` from previous periods to explain current `\(y\)`

---
# No plausible alternative explanation

- No other variable `\(z\)` can influence the change in `\(y\)` we attribute to `\(x\)`

--

- Employment rate among those who participated in a job training program is 75% compared to 40% among those who did not participate.

--

- Conclusion: Job training programs increase the likelihood of employment by 35 percentage points. 

- Plausible alternatives?

# Directed Acyclical Graphs (DAGS)

---
# DAGS

- Visual representation of causal pathways

- Forces us to consider our assumptions

- Allows for a systematic evaluation of causal model, especially using **observational**, **non-experimental** data

---
# Regression and DAGS

- Behind every regression is a DAG

`$$Happiness=\beta_0+\beta_1Age+\beta_2Income+\epsilon$$`

&lt;img src="lectures_files/dag15.png" width="843" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Notation and Rules

.pull-left[

- Solid arrow: effect is observable
- Dashed arrow: effect is unobservable
- Arrows claim correlation, at least

- Two types of paths:
  - Direct `\(X \rightarrow Y\)`
  - Mediated (indirect) `\(X \rightarrow Z \rightarrow Y\)`

]

.pull-right[

&lt;img src="lectures_files/dag2.png" width="336" /&gt;

- No two-way arrows
- No direct path from `\(Y\)` back to `\(X\)`

]

---
# Our focus on DAGS

- Backdoor paths

- Adjusting for **confounding** and **colliding** variables

- Translating regression to DAGS and vice versa

- Further reading: Pearl, J. (2018). [The Book of Why](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CYJ4G2L/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_QlXEFb2CK71MS)

---
# Backdoor path

&lt;img src="lectures_files/dag3.png" width="552" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- `\(Z\)` is a **confounder**

- Leads to **omitted variable bias** (OVB)

---
# Close the backdoor

- Our goal is to close all backdoor paths between `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)`

- Three ways to close a backdoor path

--

1. Control for the **confounder** in our regression

---
# Close the backdoor

&lt;img src="lectures_files/dag4.png" width="700" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

.pull-left[
`$$Y=\beta_0+\beta_1X+\epsilon$$`

- Backdoor open - OVB
]

.pull-right[
`$$Y=\beta_0+\beta_1X+\beta_2Z+\epsilon$$`

- Backdoor closed - No OVB
]

---
# Close the backdoor

- Three ways to close a backdoor path

1. Control for the **confounder**

--

2. Control for any variable along the backdoor path

---
# Close the backdoor

&lt;img src="lectures_files/dag4.2.png" width="447" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

.center[
`$$X \rightarrow Y$$`
`$$X \leftarrow Z \rightarrow K \rightarrow Y$$`
]

.pull-left[
`$$Y=\beta_0+\beta_1X+\epsilon$$`

- Backdoor open; OVB
]

.pull-right[
`$$Y=\beta_0+\beta_1X+\beta_2K+\epsilon$$`

- Backdoor closed/blocked; no OVB
]

---
# Close the backdoor

- Three ways to close a backdoor path

1. Control for the **confounder**

--

2. Control for any variable along the backdoor path

--

3. Identify a **collider** variable that closes the backdoor path

---
# Collider variable

&lt;img src="lectures_files/dag6.png" width="533" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- `\(Z\)` is a **collider** in this case

- Colliders close backdoors

---
# Close the backdoor

&lt;img src="lectures_files/dag5.png" width="351" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

.center[
`\(X \rightarrow Y\)`

`\(X \leftarrow Z \rightarrow K \leftarrow Y\)`
]

.pull-left[
`$$Y=\beta_0+\beta_1X+\epsilon$$`
`$$Y=\beta_0+\beta_1X+\beta_2Z+\epsilon$$`
`$$Y=\beta_0+\beta_1X+\beta_2Z+\beta_3K+\epsilon$$`
- All are fine; backdoor closed
]

.pull-right[
`$$Y=\beta_0+\beta_1X+\beta_2K+\epsilon$$`

- Backdoor open; OVB

- **Controlling for a collider opens the backdoor it closed**
]

---
# The error term and OVB

&lt;img src="lectures_files/dag8.png" width="796" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

.center[

`$$Y=\beta_0+\beta_1X+\epsilon$$`

]

- If true model was left DAG, our estimate `\(b_1\)` is *not* solely due to `\(X\)`, but rather unobserved factors contained in `\(\epsilon\)`

- Referred to as **endogeneity** or "X is endogenous"

---
# Error term and OVB

.center[
`$$Happiness=\beta_0+\beta_1Age+\beta_2Income+\epsilon$$`]

.pull-left[
&lt;img src="lectures_files/dag15.png" width="843" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

.pull-right[
- What variables might the error term contain?

- Do any of our omitted variables also affect age or income?

# Using DAGS systematically

---
# Using DAGS

1. Begin with the direct path between `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)` based on your research question

2. Identify other factors that affect `\(X\)` and/or `\(Y\)`, adding them to the DAG accordingly

3. List all paths starting from `\(X\)` to `\(Y\)`

4. Identify any backdoor paths and determine how to close them

---
# Using DAGS

- Suppose we want to know if college, `\(C\)`, increases earnings, `\(Y\)`?

- `\(C \rightarrow Y\)`

`$$Y=\beta_0+\beta_1C+\epsilon$$`

--

- Now we should think of all the factors that affect earnings and/or going to college

- Suppose we identify three factors: 
  - Parent's education `\(PE\)` 
  - Family income `\(I\)` 
  - Natural aptitude of parents/child `\(A\)`

---
# Using DAGS

- Now we think of the relationships between all of our factors and draw the corresponding DAG

- Suppose we settle on the following DAG

&lt;img src="lectures_files/dag10.png" width="473" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- Next step is to list paths between `\(C\)` and `\(Y\)`

---
# Using DAGS

&lt;img src="lectures_files/dag10.png" width="394" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

1. `\(C \rightarrow Y\)` (the causal effect of college on earnings)

--

2. `\(C \leftarrow I \rightarrow Y\)` (backdoor 1)

--

3. `\(C \leftarrow PE \rightarrow I \rightarrow Y\)` (backdoor 2)

--

4. `\(C \leftarrow A \rightarrow PE \rightarrow I \rightarrow Y\)` (backdoor3)

--

- Any colliders? No. We have three open backdoor paths. Systematic non-causal correlations between `\(C\)` and `\(Y\)`

---
# Using DAGS

1. `\(C \rightarrow Y\)` (the causal effect of college on earnings)
2. `\(C \leftarrow I \rightarrow Y\)` (backdoor 1)
3. `\(C \leftarrow PE \rightarrow I \rightarrow Y\)` (backdoor 2)
4. `\(C \leftarrow A \rightarrow PE \rightarrow I \rightarrow Y\)` (backdoor3)

- Next step is to identify the minimum set of control variables needed to close all backdoors.

--

- Controlling for family income `\(I\)` closes all three backdoors

.center[
`$$Y=\beta_0+\beta_1C+\beta_2I+\epsilon$$`
]

- If we believe this DAG, then we now have the causal effect of college on earnings.

---
# Assumptions &amp; alternatives

&lt;img src="lectures_files/dag10.png" width="394" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- Two key assumptions this DAG makes

--

1. Other than natural aptitude `\(A\)`, no other *unobserved* factors affect `\(C\)`

--

2. Natural aptitude does not directly affect earnings `\(Y\)`

---
# Assumptions &amp; alternatives

&lt;img src="lectures_files/dag11.png" width="389" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

.pull-left[
1. `\(C \rightarrow Y\)` 
2. `\(C \leftarrow I \rightarrow Y\)` 
3. `\(C \leftarrow PE \rightarrow I \rightarrow Y\)`
4. `\(C \leftarrow A \rightarrow PE \rightarrow I \rightarrow Y\)` 
5. `\(C \leftarrow A \rightarrow Y\)`
6. `\(C \leftarrow PE \leftarrow A \rightarrow Y\)`
7. `\(C \leftarrow I \leftarrow PE \leftarrow A \rightarrow Y\)`
]

.pull-right[

- Controlling for `\(I\)` closes 2, 3, 4, &amp; 7

- Controlling for `\(PE\)` closes 6

- Currently no way to close 5; our causal hopes are dashed

# Collider Bias Revisited

---
# Collider bias

- Collider bias can occur in two ways:

- Controlling for a collider in our regression in a way that opens a backdoor path that would have been closed

- Using a sample where observations are based on a collider variable

---
# Collider bias: bad control

&lt;img src="lectures_files/dag12.png" width="351" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

1. `\(Marijuana \rightarrow CarAcc\)`
2. `\(Marijuana \leftarrow Norms \rightarrow Seatbelt \leftarrow Safety \rightarrow CarAcc\)`


`$$CarAcc = \beta_0 + \beta_1Marijuana + \beta_2Seatbelt + \epsilon$$`

- Controlling for seatbelt usage would introduce bias


---
# Seeing collider bias

- Creating a dataset with 2500 observations and 3 variables drawn randomly from a normal distribution


```r
collider_bias &lt;- data.frame(k = rnorm(2500, mean = 10, sd = 4), 
                            e = rnorm(2500), 
                            u = rnorm(2500))
```


|     k|     e|     u|
|-----:|-----:|-----:|
|  7.76| -0.68| -0.49|
|  9.08|  0.57|  1.13|
| 16.23| -0.70| -1.15|
| 10.28| -0.53|  1.48|

---
# Seeing collider bias

- Adding the explanatory variable of interest `\(X\)` equal to 1 when `\(k\)` is greater than or equal to 12 (arbitrary choice)


```r
collider_bias &lt;- collider_bias %&gt;% 
  mutate(X = if_else( k &gt;= 12, 1, 0))
```

--

- Creating a known parameter for the effect of `\(X\)` on `\(Y\)`. 


```r
collider_bias &lt;- collider_bias %&gt;% 
  mutate(Y = 100 + 50*X + e)
```

--

- Creating a collider `\(Z\)` that is a function of `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)`.


```r
collider_bias &lt;- collider_bias %&gt;% 
  mutate(Z = 50*X + 10*Y + u)
```

---
# Seeing collider bias

- Now have the data we need to run two regressions


|  X|      Y|       Z|
|--:|------:|-------:|
|  0|  99.32|  992.72|
|  0| 100.57| 1006.87|
|  1| 149.30| 1541.81|
|  0|  99.47|  996.14|

`$$Y=\beta_0 + \beta_1X + \epsilon$$`

`$$Y=\beta_0 + \beta_1X + \beta_2Z + \epsilon$$`


```r
valid &lt;- lm(Y ~ X, data = collider_bias)
biased &lt;- lm(Y ~ X + Z, data = collider_bias)
```

]

- Coefficient for `\(X\)` should be 50 because I made it so.

- Because `\(X \rightarrow Z \leftarrow Y\)`, controlling for Z introduces serious bias

---
# Collider bias: bad sample

- Suppose a nonprofit that works with at-risk youth wants to understand the effect of school absences on grades. It only has access to data on its own clients.

- Suppose at-risk youth are identified by socioeconomic status, GPA, and absences

&lt;img src="lectures_files/dag13.png" width="385" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Collider bias (2) bad sample

`$$GPA = \beta_0 + \beta_1TotAbsences + \beta_2 SES + \epsilon$$`

&lt;img src="lectures_files/dag13.png" width="385" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

.pull-left[

1. `\(TA \rightarrow GPA\)`
2. `\(TA \leftarrow SES \rightarrow GPA\)`
3. `\(TA \rightarrow AtRisk \leftarrow GPA\)`
4. `\(TA \leftarrow SES \rightarrow AtRisk \leftarrow GPA\)`

]

.pull-right[

- Will our estimate `\(b_1\)` be unbiased?

- No. Because our sample is selected from `\(AtRisk\)`; same as controlling for it.

- Selection bias
]

# Seeing selection bias

`\(Absent \rightarrow AtRisk \leftarrow GPA\)`

# Recap

- What would be the ideal experiment and how does my analysis differ?

--

- Is my theoretical claim credible? Can I claim there is no OVB?

--

- If so, internally valid. Now we can consider **external validity**.

---
# External validity

- **External validity (generalizability):** can results of research be applied beyond the groups or context being studied?

--

- Are those in my sample systematically different than those in the population?

- Probably, but if not, can generalize to population.

--

- If different, was my sample drawn from a collider?

  - Yes. Then all backdoors are not closed.
  - No. Then may be able to generalize to the subgroup my sample represents. (Example: effect of job training on participants instead of any unemployed person)

---
# Causal inference models

&lt;img src="lectures_files/dag14.png" width="468" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- Random assignment breaks any OVB from the error term

- Random assignment is often difficult to achieve in social sciences

- There are quasi-experimental regression techniques that arguably achieve the same break from the error term as if random
  - Difference-in-differences, regression discontinuity, instrumental variables, synthetic control, fixed effects, propensity score matching
