# Outline

- Identify the unit of analysis

- Identify types of variables
  - Categorical: Nominal & Ordinal
  - Numerical: Discrete & Continuous

- Identify types of data structures
  - Cross-sectional
  - Pooled cross-sectional
  - Time series
  - Panel

- Review of R Chapter

# Rectangular data

- Rectangular data consists of

  - Unit of analysis
  - Variables

--

- **Unit of analysis**:  the subject (person, place, or thing) generating the data

- Each row is a record/observation of the unit of analysis

--

- **Variable**:  a characteristic observed on unit of analysis

---
# Rectangular data

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
generic <- tibble(ID = c("Unit of Analysis", "Unit", "Unit"),
                  Variable_1 = c("Datum", "Datum", "Datum"),
                  Variable_2 = c("Datum", "Datum", "Datum"))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
kable(generic, format = 'html')
```

- Each row is (or should be) an **observation**

- Each column is (or should be) a **variable**

---
# Unit of analysis

- The unit of analysis uniquely identifies each row in a data set. Let's practice.

--

- What is the likely unit of analysis based on the variable names?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
generic <- tibble(ID = c("Unit of Analysis", "Unit", "Unit"),
                  GDP = c("Datum", "Datum", "Datum"),
                  Population = c("Datum", "Datum", "Datum"))
kable(generic, format = 'html')
```

---
# Unit of analysis

- What is the likely unit of analysis based on the variable names?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
generic <- tibble(ID = c("Unit of Analysis", "Unit", "Unit"),
                  GRE_Score = c("Datum", "Datum", "Datum"),
                  Income = c("Datum", "Datum", "Datum"))
kable(generic, format = 'html')
```

---
# Unit of analysis

- What is the unit of analysis based on the variable names?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
generic <- tibble(Year = c(2017, 2018, 2019),
                  Unemployment = c("Datum", "Datum", "Datum"),
                  Poverty = c("Datum", "Datum", "Datum"))
kable(generic, format = 'html')
```

class: inverse, middle, center

# Suppose we want to investigate homelessness in Athens-Clarke County. We need to collect data.

---
class: inverse, middle, center

# With your group, develop a list of variables we might want to collect if the unit of analysis is **years**. Then develop a second list of variables if the unit of analysis is **individuals**.

---
# Types of variables

![](lectures_files/variables.png)

---
# Qualitative vs. quantitative

- A **qualitative** or **categorical** variable is a variable that is naturally expressed in words with no intrinsic numerical value

--

- A **quantitative** or **numerical** variable is a variable that has intrinsic numerical meaning

---
class: inverse, middle, center

# In your group, identify which of your variables are qualitative and which are quantitative?

---
# Types of qualitative variables
.center[
![:scale 40%](lectures_files/categorical.png) ]

- **Nominal** variables take on values that differ by name only

- **Ordinal** variables take on values that can be ranked relative to each other but the difference between rankings has no numerical value

---
# Types of quantitative variables
.center[
![:scale 40%](lectures_files/quantitative.png) ]

- **Discrete** variables take on numeric values that are **countable**, integers (e.g. 0, 1, 2, ...)

- **Continuous** variables take on potentially any value. For example, a percentage ranges between 0 and 100 but can take on infinite values between that range (e.g. 50, 50.4, 50.44, 50.444, ...) even though we round to a finite set of values.  

---
class: inverse, middle, center

# In your group, identify which of your qualitative variables are nominal or ordinal. Identify which of your quantitative variables are discrete or continuous?

# Recap of variable types

---
# Variables and information

- Variables measure a characteristic of the unit of analysis

- Each variable has some amount of information encoded into it

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.height='50%'}
include_graphics("lectures_files/varinfo.png")
```

---
# Types (scales) of continuous variables

- **Interval** variables (or the interval scale) are continuous variables with no meaningful zero

- **Ratio** variables (or the ratio scale) are continuous variables with a meaningful zero

- **Index** variables are constructed from multiple variables
  - Can make a continuous variables out of categorical variables
  - Simplify multidimensional measures into one measure
  - Example:  [Global Multidimensional Poverty Index](http://hdr.undp.org/en/2018-MPI)

---
# Why should we care?

- Types of variables inform what kind of visualization and statistical analysis to use. 

- For [example](https://coggle.it/diagram/Vxlydu1akQFeqo6-/t/inference).

# Dataset structures

---
# Cross-sectional

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(gapminder)
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007 & continent == 'Americas') %>% 
  head(n=3) %>% 
  kable(format = 'html')
```

- A snapshot in time
- What is the unit of analysis?

---
# Pooled cross-sectional

```{r, echo=FALSE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter((year == 2007 & continent == 'Americas') | (year==2002 & continent=='Africa')) %>% 
  head(n=7) %>% 
  kable(format = 'html')
```

- Multiple cross-sections combined
- Different subjects observed in each cross-section

---
# Time Series

```{r, echo=FALSE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(country == 'Argentina') %>% 
  tail(n=7) %>% 
  kable(format = 'html')
```

- One subject across time
- Unit of analysis?

---
# Panel/longitudinal data

```{r, echo=FALSE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent == 'Americas', year >= 1997) %>% 
  head(n=6) %>% 
  kable(format = 'html')
```

- Same subjects observed across time
- Unit of analysis?
