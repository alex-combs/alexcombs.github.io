# Why statistics

- Data is the raw material of knowledge

- Statistics is the most powerful tool we have to convert raw information into something useful

- Helps us become better critical thinkers

# Planes and bullet holes

.pull-left[

![:scale 75%](Intro_Slides_files/plane.png)

Suppose we had 100 pounds (or 45.5 kg) of armor to add to each plane. How would you explain the best way to distribute that armor around the plane based on the data?

]

.pull-right[

Data from planes returning from battle:

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
bholes <- tibble(plane_section = c("Engine", "Body", "Fuel System", "Wings"),
                      holes_per_sqft = c(1.11, 1.73, 1.55, 1.8))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
kable(head(bholes), format = 'html')
```

# MPA Objectives

[Network of Schools of Public Policy, Affairs, and Administration](https://www.naspaa.org) promotes five core competencies

--

1. To Lead and Manage in Public Governance

2. To Participate in the Public Policy Process

3. **To analyze, synthesize, think critically, solve problems and make decisions**

4. To articulate and apply a public service perspective

5. To Communicate with a Diverse Workforce and Citizenry

---

# Why learn R

- Adams, et al. (2013) Statistical Software for Curriculum and Careers. Journal of Public Affairs Education.

  - 80% of MPA schools use stats software other than Excel
  
  - 30% of public sector jobs asked for (at least) familiarity with stats software other than Excel

--

- **Reproducability**

--

- R is popular across many industries

- R is free

- Coding requires deeper thinking about data and statistics than point-and-click

---
# Why learn R

![](Intro_Slides_files/proco.png)

<br>

- Both sides need to communicate

- We are always consuming statistics

- Producing helps you be a more critical consumer

# Complementary R Skills

- Workflow
- Import data
- Export data and reports
- Preparing data
- Visualizations
- Automating tables

# Balancing Concepts and R

- Operating R is initial focus

- Statistical concepts relatively simple at first, then complexity increases around Week 6

- Struggling with R is part of the process
  - Do not worry
  - Practice R frequently

---

# Course Materials

- All materials are free

- Almost all materials produced using R

- Text: [Data Apps in PA](https://alex-combs.github.io/data-apps-text/)
  - List of supplemental texts provided in the preface

- Slides mostly build off of text with different examples or additional R code that may be helpful for assignments
