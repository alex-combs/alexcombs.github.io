# Why statistics

- Data is the raw material of knowledge

--

- Statistics is the most powerful tool we have to convert raw information into something useful

![:scale 75%](Intro_Slides_files/plane.png)

Suppose we had 100 pounds/kg of armor to add to each plane. How would you explain the best way to distribute that armor around the plane?

.pull-right[

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
bholes <- tibble(plane_section = c("Engine", "Body", "Fuel System", "Wings"),
                      holes_per_sqft = c(1.11, 1.73, 1.55, 1.8))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
kable(head(bholes), format = 'html')
