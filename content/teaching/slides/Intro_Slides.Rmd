2. Review syllabus

3. RLab1:  Introduction to R

# Course Objectives

![](Intro_Slides_files/proco.png)

<br>

- Both sides need to communicate

- We are always consuming statistics

- Producing helps you be a more conscientious consumer

---
class: inverse, center, middle

# My objective is to help make you as competitive as possible in your respective job markets by being competent in statistics and statistical software.

---

# Why learn R

- Adams, et al. (2013) Statistical Software for Curriculum and Careers. Journal of Public Affairs Education.

  - 80% of MPA schools use stats software besides Excel
  
  - 30% of public sector jobs asked for (at least) familiarity with stats software besides Excel

--

- R is dominant in data science

- Learning R is harder but more generalizable

- R is free

---

# Why statistics

- Data is the raw material of knowledge

--

- Statistics is the most powerful tool we have to convert raw information into something useful

--

- Competency in statistics helps us be better thinkers in all areas of life because a lot of key concepts are not strictly mathematical

---

# Let's consider an example how statistics can help us think more good

# Planes and bullet holes

.pull-left[

![:scale 75%](Intro_Slides_files/plane.png)

Suppose we had 100 pounds/kg of armor to add to each plane. How would you explain the best way to distribute that armor around the plane?

]

.pull-right[

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
bholes <- tibble(plane_section = c("Engine", "Body", "Fuel System", "Wings"),
                      holes_per_sqft = c(1.11, 1.73, 1.55, 1.8))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
kable(head(bholes), format = 'html')
```

# My Availablility

- Office:  Baldwin 278
- Office Hours: 
- Email:  

As a general rule, if I can answer your email in 5 minutes, I answer it immediately. If you think I can help you in-person within 30 minutes, feel free to stop by and expect to be helped. If more time is required, helping you is my top priority during office hours. Otherwise, I'll meet or respond to emails when my schedule allows.

# Assignments

---
class: inverse, middle, center

# RLab1: Introduction to R and R Workflow

---

# Starting R

- You need to have R and RStudio installed on your computer

- Launch RStudio

- Get your bearings

---

# File Directory

- Type `getwd()` into the console (bottom-left pane) and hit `Enter`

- When you tell R to look for or save a file, this is the location R uses

---
# R Projects

## R Projects are the best way to organize your work in R

- I will show you how to create an R Project

- Our objective is to create a project called `RLAB1` in a file location of our choice

- You can find plenty of instruction on the web (including our textbooks) if you forget how

---
# Opening data already formatted for R

- Download the file titled `states1.RData` on eLC. Leave it wherever your computer saved it (probably your `Downloads` folder)

- Type `load(states1.RData)` in the console and hit `Enter`

--

- Error in load(states1.RData) : object 'states1.RData' not found
Calls: <Anonymous> ... withCallingHandlers -> withVisible -> eval -> eval -> load
Execution halted

- What is wrong?

--

- Remember, R looks for files in your project folder

- You can include the file path `load(folder/folder/states1.RData)`

- Or you can move the file to your project folder and the previous code should work

---
# Starting a document

- RStudio can output several types of files
  - PDF
  - Word
  - HTML for websites or files that open in your browser

--

- Any of the above start with editing one of several R documents
  - Script - bare bones to run code
  - RMarkdown - allows to make all sorts of things [video](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html)
  - Notebook - same as RMarkdown but interactive so we can run code and see results in real-time.
  
---

# Scripts

- Open a script

- If all you need is run some code without caring a finished document, use scripts

- Scripts support two elements:
  - Code
  - Comments
  - Use a hashtag `#` so R knows what is a comment
  
```{r}
# This is a comment. Below is an arbitrary formula.
((5+5)/2)^2
```

---
# Objects

- Objects are anything you tell R to temporarily save during a session. The environment pane keeps a list of all objects. Think of objects as different sheets in an Excel file--each sheet can be anything you want. 

- You should already have an object `states1`

- Let's create another object using the code below

```{r}
x <- ((5+5)/2)^2
```

- The `<-` symbol is called the assignment operator. It tells R to save the result of the thing on the right side as the name on the left side.

- The keyboard shortcut for the assignment is `Alt-` on PC or `Option-` on Mac. Speaking of keyboard shortcuts...

---
# Why save an object?

- We create an object whenever we want to use something for later or save it as a file.

- Suppose `x` is *super* interesting but your boss wants to know what `x` is squared.

- You don't need to recreate `x`. You can just square `x`.

```{r}
x^2
```

```{r}
xsquared <- x^2
```

```{r}
xsquared
```

---
# R Notebook

- We will use notebooks in this class

- Start a notebook--the template is informative

- The R Markdown cheatsheet is more informative
  - Go to Help->Cheatsheets->R Markdown Cheat Sheet
  
- Let's add a few headers to the template

---
# Knitting a notebook

- Knit the template to HTML

- Name the notebook `test`

- You should see two new files in your `files` pane (bottom-right) titled `test.Rmd` and `test.html`.

---
# YAML header

- The YAML header tell R how to format the output

- Change the YAML to the following

```{r, eval=FALSE}
---
title:  'Test'
author: 'Your Name'
output:
  html_document: default
  word_document: default
---
```

- Knit the `test` notebook to Word

- Knit the `test` notebook to PDF

- Which do you like more?

---
# Making the Word output look a little better

- Download the file titled `rlabs_styledoc.docx` to your project folder

- Change the YAML of your notebook

```{r, eval=FALSE}
title:  'Test'
author: 'Your Name'
output:
  html_document: default
  word_document: 
    reference_docx: rlabs_styledoc.docx
```

- Knit to Word again

---
# So what?

- Now you have the option to produce output in Word or PDF

- Use one of these for every RLab

- If you prefer Word, use the above YAML everytime

---
class: inverse, middle, center

# Let's create our first RLab notebook and post on eLC

---
# RLAB1 Notebook

- Download the file `RLab1_Profile` on eLC and add to your `RLab1` project folder

- Complete the instructions in the `RLab1_Profile` until you reach the competencies section

---
# Competencies

The National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration (NASSPA) promotes six competencies in methods. Rate yourself on these competencies using the following scale:

1. Not familiar enough with the topic to rate myself
2. I have some competency but need improvement to achieve professional goals
3. Do not need improvement to achieve professional goals
4. Not to brag, but I'm basically an expert

---
# Adding code chunks

- Add a code chunk that executes some basic arithmetic

- Save the result to an object called `math`

---
# Packages

R loads with a lot of base functionality, but some things we want to do requires us to install or load additional packages into our R session. A package is simply a set of functions that augments the base functionality of R.

> Very important: Your notebook won't knit if you use code that requires a package that you haven't loaded inside of your notebook.

--

- Try this code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
kable(states1)
```

Error in kable(states1) : could not find function "kable"

---
# Loading packages

To load a package, it has to be installed on your computer. You only need to install a package once.

- Let's install the `knitr` package that contains the `kable` function

- Execute the following code in your **console**

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(kable)
```

- Once installed, now we can load a package. Add this code to your notebook.

```{r}
library(knitr)
```

---
# Printing a table

- Add another code chunk

- Load the `states1` data

```{r, eval=FALSE}
load("states1.RData")
```

- Now try knitting to HTML

---
# Knitting in order

> Your notebook knits in the order of your code chunks. If you use a function on data that you load **below** the function, it's the same as not having the data loaded.

> If a code chunk depends on another chunk, then the latter needs to be done before the former.

- Copy-and-paste the `load` chunk above the `kable` chunk.

- Knit to HTML again. Does it work?

---
# Posting to eLC

- eLC's discussion boards does not play well with HTML, so you will need to post RLabs using Word or PDF

- Knit your notebook to Word or PDF

- Post the .docx or .pdf file to the RLab1 discussion forum
