# Why this course

- Data is the raw material of knowledge

- Statistics is the most powerful tool we have to convert raw information into something useful

---

# MPA Objectives

[Network of Schools of Public Policy, Affairs, and Administration](https://www.naspaa.org) promotes five core competencies

--

1. To Lead and Manage in Public Governance

2. To Participate in the Public Policy Process

3. **To analyze, synthesize, think critically, solve problems and make decisions**

4. To articulate and apply a public service perspective

5. To Communicate with a Diverse Workforce and Citizenry

---

# Why R

- Adams, et al. (2013) Statistical Software for Curriculum and Careers. Journal of Public Affairs Education.

  - 80% of MPA schools use stats software other than Excel
  
  - 30% of public sector jobs asked for (at least) familiarity with stats software other than Excel

- Reproducibility and Automation

- R is popular and free

- Encourages deeper thinking about data and statistics than point-and-click

---
# Why learn R

![](Intro_Slides_files/proco.png)

<br>

- Both sides need to communicate

- We are constantly consuming statistics or information drawn from a statistical analysis

- Producing helps you be a more knowledgeable consumer

# Complementary Data App Skills

- Workflow
- Import data
- Export data and reports
- Preparing data
- Visualizations
- Automating tables

---
# Balancing Concepts and R

- How to use R is initial focus

- Statistical concepts relatively simple at first, then complexity increases around Week 6 with regression

- Struggles with R, especially the first few weeks, is part of the process. Try not to feel discouraged.

---
# Course Materials & Assignments

- All materials are available on eLC

- 8 R Chapters (10% of grade)

- 9 R Labs (10% of grade)

- 3 Problem sets (45% of grade)

- 2 Exams (35% of grade)

- 15 DataCamp Chapters for up to 4.0 points of extra credit

---
# R Chapters

- Provide regular practice using R

- Graded complete/incomplete conditional on good faith effort

- Answers available on eLC once you upload your answers

- Compare your work to the answers. Send questions via the eLC comments or bring to class.

---
# R Labs

- Supervised R practice

- Graded complete/incomplete if you work on RLab in class

- If you miss class, due by 12:00PM the next day following class. In this case, I will grade based on accuracy and completeness to prevent students falling behind.

- I will post answers later in the week.

---
# Problem sets

- 3 problem sets

- Combination of concepts (readings and lectures) and applied skills using R (R chapters and labs)

- Each week will cover concepts and skills that apply to the current or next problem set
  - I will let you know when we have covered everything that applies to the current problem set
  - We will cover everything applicable to the current problem set at least a week before it is due

---
# Working on problem sets

- Designed to be worked on some each week, not all at once

- Questions do not necessarily progress in the same order as our weekly topics. 

- If you reach a question we haven't covered, there may be questions that follow it that we have covered.

- Review the problem set after each class and make note of which questions you should be able to answer.

---
# Working on problem sets: Groups

- You can choose to work on problem sets individually or in a group of up to 3

- Groups are encouraged to work together simultaneously rather than independently on separate parts of the problem set

---
# Problem set groups

- I will place everyone in a group on eLC

- If you would like to work in a group and need my help finding others to work with, email me before our class meeting on **January 16**

- If you have established a group on your own, someone email me the names of the members by **January 23**

---
# Exams

- Midterm and final administered via eLC

- Focus on concepts and interpretation of statistical analysis

- Exams do not require you to use R

---
# DataCamp Chapters

- Optional

- Recommended order provided on course schedule

- Opportunity for extra credit closes after April 2nd

- Invite link on eLC. Use your uga.edu email address to join

- Be sure the chapters you complete are the ones that count toward extra credit

---
# Attendance & Office Hours

- Attendance not required; no explanation needed unless pertains to missing a due date

- Link to schedule office hours is on eLC.
