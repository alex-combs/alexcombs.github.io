# Why statistics

- Data is the raw material of knowledge

- Statistics is the most powerful tool we have to convert raw information into something useful

- Helps us be more critical thinkers

# Planes and bullet holes

.pull-left[

![:scale 75%](Intro_Slides_files/plane.png)

Suppose we had 100 pounds (or 45.5 kg) of armor to add to each plane. How would you explain the best way to distribute that armor around the plane based on the data?

.pull-right[

Data from planes returning from battle:

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
bholes <- tibble(plane_section = c("Engine", "Body", "Fuel System", "Wings"),
                      holes_per_sqft = c(1.11, 1.73, 1.55, 1.8))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
kable(head(bholes), format = 'html')
```

# Why learn R

- Adams, et al. (2013) Statistical Software for Curriculum and Careers. Journal of Public Affairs Education.

  - 80% of MPA schools use stats software other than Excel
  
  - 30% of public sector jobs asked for (at least) familiarity with stats software other than Excel

--

- **Replication**

--

- R is popular across many industries

- R is free

- Struggle of programming helps you think and learn

# Why learn R

![](Intro_Slides_files/proco.png)

<br>

- Both sides need to communicate

- We are always consuming statistics

- Producing helps you be a more critical consumer

# Balancing Concepts and R

- Operating R is primary focus at first, then we will turn more to concepts

- Statistical concepts initially easy, then increase in difficulty

- Initial struggles are part of the process; do not worry

---

# Course Materials

- All materials are free

- Almost all materials produced using R

- Text: [Data Apps in PA](https://alex-combs.github.io/data-apps-text/)
  - List of supplemental texts provided in the preface

- Slides mostly build off of text with different examples or additional R code that may be helpful for assignments

---
