# Why this course

- Data is the raw material of knowledge

- Statistics is the most powerful tool we have to convert raw information into something useful

---

# MPA Objectives

[Network of Schools of Public Policy, Affairs, and Administration](https://www.naspaa.org) promotes five core competencies

--

1. To Lead and Manage in Public Governance

2. To Participate in the Public Policy Process

3. **To analyze, synthesize, think critically, solve problems and make decisions**

4. To articulate and apply a public service perspective

5. To Communicate with a Diverse Workforce and Citizenry

---

# Why R

- Adams, et al. (2013) Statistical Software for Curriculum and Careers. Journal of Public Affairs Education.

  - 80% of MPA schools use stats software other than Excel
  
  - 30% of public sector jobs asked for (at least) familiarity with stats software other than Excel

--

- **Reproducibility and Automation**

--

- R is popular and free

- Encourages deeper thinking about data and statistics than point-and-click

---
# Why learn R

![](Intro_Slides_files/proco.png)

<br>

- Both sides need to communicate

- We are always consuming statistics

- Producing helps you be a more critical consumer

# Complementary R Skills

- Workflow
- Import data
- Export data and reports
- Preparing data
- Visualizations
- Automating tables

---
# Balancing Concepts and R

- How to use R is initial focus

- Statistical concepts relatively simple at first, then complexity increases around Week 6

- Struggling with R is part of the process; do not feel discouraged

---
# Course Materials & Assignments

- All materials are available on eLC

--

- 9 R Chapters (10% of grade)

- 10 R Labs (10% of grade)

- 4 Problem sets (50% of grade)

- 2 Exams (30% of grade)

- 15 DataCamp Chapters for up to 4.5 points of extra credit

---
# R Chapters

- Provide regular practice using R

- Graded complete/incomplete conditional on good faith effort

- Answers available on eLC once you upload your answers

- Compare your work to the answers. Send questions via the eLC comments or bring to class.

---
# R Labs

- Supervised R practice

- Instructions will become available 30 minutes before class

- Graded complete/incomplete if you work on RLab in class

- If you miss class, due by 12:00PM the Wednesday following class. I will count as incomplete if they are not sufficiently complete and accurate.

---
# Problem sets

- 4 problem sets

- Combination of concepts (readings and lectures) and applied skills using R (R chapters and labs)

- Each week will cover concepts and skills that apply to the current or next problem set
  - I will let you know when we have covered everything that applies to the current problem set
  - We will cover everything applicable to the current problem set at least a week before it is due

---
# Working on problem sets: Tips

- Designed to be worked on  each week, not all at once

- Questions do not necessarily progress in the same order as our weekly topics. 

- If you reach a question we haven't covered, there may be questions that follow it that we have covered.

- Review the problem set after each class and make note of which questions you should be able to answer.

---
# Working on problem sets: Groups

- You can choose to work on problem sets individually or in a group of up to 3

- Groups are encouraged to work together simultaneously rather than independently on separate parts of the problem set

---
# Problem set groups

- I will place everyone in a group on eLC even if it is a group of one

- **Email me before our class meeting on September 12 if:**
  - you have established a group on your own. Provide the names of the other members.
  - If you would like to work in a group and need my help finding others to work with.

---
# Exams

- Midterm and final administered via eLC

- Focus on concepts and interpretation of statistical analysis

- Exams do not require you to use R

---
# DataCamp Chapters

- Optional

- Recommended order provided on course schedule

- Opportunity for extra credit closes on November 21 at 11:59PM

- Invite link on eLC. Use your uga.edu email address to join.

---
# Attendance & Office Hours

- Attendance not required; no explanation needed unless pertains to missing a deadline

- Link to schedule office hours is on eLC.
