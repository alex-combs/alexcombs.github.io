# Outline



- Preliminary cleaning
  - rename variables
  - change variable type
- Wrangle verbs
  - extract observations/rows using `filter`
  - extract variables/columns using `select`
  - create or change variables using `mutate`
  - reorder rows using `arrange`
- Other
  - print top or bottom rows using `head` and `tail`
  - combine functions using the pipe operator `%&gt;%`
  - provide descriptive stats using `summarize` and `group_by`

---
# Why learn data wrangling

  
- Create a table we want to print in a report

- Our analysis requires us to transform the original dataset
  
--

- 80/20 rule: About 80% of time spent on analysis goes toward preparing data 

- Learning statistics is not nearly as useful if you can't prepare data

- Software like R can save you a lot of time.

---
# Set-up

.pull-left[

&gt; **If using RStudio Cloud, do not create a new project. Instead, use the project you created for where you already installed `tidyverse`. Installed packages do not carry over to other project spaces.**

]

.pull-right[

&gt; **Otherwise, create a new project named "rlab3". I recommend locating it in the same parent file as your other RLab folders.**

]

---
# Setup
  
&gt; **Start a new R Markdown document and click "OK"**

&gt; **Keep setup code chunk at the top. Change code to `echo=FALSE`**

&gt; **Change YAML:**


```r
---
title: "RLab3: Data Wrangling"
author: "Your Name"
output:
  html_document:
    df_print: paged
---
```

&gt; **Delete rest of the template.**

---
# Setup: packages

&gt; **In the setup code chunk, load the following packages:**


```r
library(tidyverse) # handles virtually all wrangling tasks
library(readxl) # to import Excel
library(knitr) # probably need to install this first
library(gapminder) # for data we will use
```

---
# Setup: data files

&gt; **Download the "state_finance_2016.csv" and "ga_schdist_clean.csv" files from eLC and add to your project folder**

- "state_finance_2016.csv" is state government finance data downloaded from the Census

- "ga_schdist_clean.csv" is almost identical to the csv file we exported at the end of last week's lab

---
# Import Data



&gt; **In the setup code chunk, import "state_finance_2016.csv" and "ga_schdist_clean.csv". You do not need to use any import options. Name the objects the same as the file names.**

--

- You should now have two objects in your environment

---
# Preview data

&gt; **Below the setup code chunk, on a new line outside of the code chunk, type a heading titled Raw Data**

--

&gt; **In a new code chunk, use the `glimpse()` function to provide our reader information about the `gapminder`, `state_finance_2016`, and `ga_schdist_clean` datasets.**

--

&gt; **Name this code chunk `preview`**

---
# Renaming variables

- One of the first things we may want to do so the rest of our code is shorter

- Variable names should be as short as possible and most prefer `snake_case_format`

- Recall we already learned how to rename variables while importing a dataset


```r
ga_schdist_raw &lt;- read_excel("ga_schdist_raw.xlsx", 
                             range = "A8:I230", 
*                            col_names = c("district","state","charter","enroll","lep", "iep","frpl","white","expenditures"),
                             col_types = c("text", "text", "text", "numeric", "numeric", "numeric", "numeric", "numeric", "numeric"))
```

---
# Renaming variables

- If we want to rename a variable in a dataset already imported, then:


```r
data_set &lt;- rename(data_set, 'new_var' = 'current_var', 
                    'new_var' = 'current_var', ...)
```

- Replace `data_set` with the name of the dataset, `'new_var'` with the new name you want, and `current_var` with the name of variable you want to change

---
# Renaming variables

- There is a variable named `id_long` in the `state_finance_2016` dataset

- Suppose I wanted to rename `id_long` to `census_code` and **overwrite** the `state_finance_2016` dataset


```r
state_finance_2016 &lt;- rename(state_finance_2016, 'census_code' = 'id_long')
```

---
# Rename skill check

&gt; **Insert a new code chunk. Name the code chunk `var_rename`.**

&gt; **Rename `id_short` to `id` in the `state_finance_2016` dataset.**



&gt; **Re-run the `glimpse` command above to see if `rename` worked as expected.**

--

&gt; **Knit to HTML. Check the `glimpse` output for `state_finance_2016`.**

- Can you figure out why the output still shows `id_short`?

---
# Converting variable types

- Recall we already learned how to convert variable types while importing a dataset


```r
ga_schdist_raw &lt;- read_excel("ga_schdist_raw.xlsx", 
                             range = "A8:I230", 
                             col_names = c("district","state","charter","enroll","lep", "iep","frpl","white","expenditures"),
*                            col_types = c("text", "text", "text", "numeric", "numeric", "numeric", "numeric", "numeric", "numeric"))
```

---
# Converting variable types

- Suppose we need to convert a variable in a dataset after importing it


```r
data_set$variable &lt;- as.newtype(data_set$variable)
```

- Replace `data_set$variable` accordingly and `as.newtype` to one of the variable type options:

--


```r
as.numeric()
as.character() #text
as.integer()
as.factor() #categorical
as.logical() # converts binary (dummy) variables to True/False
```

---
# Converting variable types

- The output of `glimpse(state_finance_2016)` shows us that the variable `state` is stored as a character/text variable

- Suppose I wanted R to recognize `state` as a categorical variable


```r
state_finance_2016$state &lt;- as.factor(state_finance_2016$state)
```

---
# Type conversion skill check

&gt; **Insert a new code chunk. Name the code chunk `type_convert`.**

&gt; **Convert `finance_type` and `finance_source` to categorical variables in the `state_finance_2016` dataset.**

--

&gt; **Re-run the `glimpse(state_finance_2016)` to check if it worked.**

---
# Rename and type conversion recap

- Can rename or convert variables during or after importing the data

- Renaming variables makes coding easier to write and read

- Converting variable types is sometimes necessary for certain functions
  - Can't perform math on a variable stored as character
  - Specifying categorical variables helps with summary stats and graphs

class: inverse, middle, center

# Wrangle verbs

---
# Wrangle motivation and choices

- Two motivations
  - Print an informative table in our report when we knit
  - Change the original data to aid in our analysis

--

- Three options when considering what to do with the result of our wrangling
  - Print the result without saving it
  - Save the result
  - Print and save the result

---
# Practice Data

- We will practice wrangle verbs using the `gapminder` dataset


|country     |continent | year| lifeExp|     pop| gdpPercap|
|:-----------|:---------|----:|-------:|-------:|---------:|
|Afghanistan |Asia      | 1952|    28.8| 8425333|     779.4|

- Continents &amp; years included


```r
levels(gapminder$continent)
```

```
## [1] "Africa"   "Americas" "Asia"     "Europe"   "Oceania"
```

```r
unique(gapminder$year)
```

```
##  [1] 1952 1957 1962 1967 1972 1977 1982 1987 1992 1997 2002 2007
```

---
# Filter

![](labs_files/filter.png)

- General syntax:


```r
filter(data_set, criteria) #prints the result
filtered_data_set &lt;- filter(data_set, criteria) #saves result
(filtered_data_set &lt;- filter(data_set, criteria)) #prints and saves the result
filtered_data_set # prints the saved result
```

---
# Filter example

Print all observations where year equals 2007


```r
filter(gapminder, year == 2007)
```

Print all observations where continent equals Africa


```r
filter(gapminder, continent == 'Africa')
```

Save a new dataset containing only observations where life expectancy is greater than 75 years. Then print it.


```r
long_life &lt;- filter(gapminder, lifeExp &gt; 75)
long_life
```

---
# Filter practice

&gt; **Type a new heading, "Wrangle Practice"**

&gt; **Type a lower-level heading, "Filter"**

&gt; **Start a new code chunk and name it filter.**

--

&gt; **Use `filter` to print all Asia observations**

&gt; **Use `filter` to print all 1952 observations**

&gt; **Use `filter` to save a new dataset named `oceania` containing only Oceania observations. Then print `oceania`.**

&gt; **Knit to HTML and inspect the output.**

---
# Conditional and logical operators

- We may want to filter on multiple criteria

- Conditionals
  - "If equal to" `==`
  - "If not equal to" `!=`
  - "If greater than, less than, or equal to" `&gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;=`

- Logicals
  - "And" `&amp;`
  - "Or" `|`

---
# Filter examples

Print all Africa observations for 2007


```r
filter(gapminder, continent == 'Africa' &amp; year == 2007)
```

--

Print all Africa and Oceania observations


```r
filter(gapminder, continent == 'Africa' | continent == 'Oceania')
```

--

Print all Africa and Oceania observations for 2007


```r
filter(gapminder, (continent == 'Africa' | continent == 'Oceania') &amp; year == 2007)
#OR
gap_ao &lt;- filter(gapminder, continent == 'Africa' | continent == 'Oceania')
filter(gap_ao, year == 2007)
```

---
# Filter Examples

Save a new dataset that removes Oceania observations


```r
no_oceania &lt;- filter(gapminder, continent != 'Oceania')
```

Print non-Oceania observations for 1992 or later


```r
filter(gapminder, continent != 'Oceania' &amp; year &gt;= 1992)
```

---
# Filter practice

&gt; **Start a new code chunk named `filter2`, write code that will filter `gapminder` according to each prompt below and print the resulting table.**

--

&gt; **Print observations in the Americas in 1952 with a life expectancy lower than 65**

--

&gt; **Print all non-Americas observations in 2007 with a GDP per capita greater than or equal to \$7,000. Feel free to use multiple steps.**

--

&gt; **Knit to HTML.**

---
# Select

![](labs_files/select.png)

- General syntax


```r
new_dataset &lt;- select(old_dataset, var1, var2, var3, ...)
# where var is the name of the variable you want to keep
```

- Or to drop variables


```r
new_dataset &lt;- select(old_dataset, -var1, -var2, ...)
```

- Whichever requires the shorter list of names

---
# Select examples

Print only country, year, and life expectancy


```r
select(gapminder, country, year, lifeExp)
```

--

Remove population and print the rest


```r
select(gapminder, -pop)
```

---
# Select practice

&gt; **Type a heading the same level as filter titled Select**

&gt; **Start a new code chunk and name it select**

&gt; **Print a table with country, year, and population**

&gt; **Print a table with country, year, population, life expectancy, and GDP per capita**

&gt; **Knit to HTML.**

---
# Subsetting

- `filter` &amp; `select` keep/remove rows and columns based on intelligent criteria

- **Subsetting** is a way to keep/remove rows and columns based on their positions in a dataset (e.g. first row or third column)

- Sometimes easier to use subsetting 

---
# Subsetting

General syntax


```r
new_dataset &lt;- dataset[row number(s) to keep or remove, 
                   column number(s) to keep or remove]
```

--


```r
new_dataset &lt;- dataset[5, 2]
# this saves the 5th row and 2nd column in a new dataset
```

--


```r
new_dataset &lt;- dataset[-5, -2]
# would drop 5th row and 2nd column
```

--


```r
new_dataset &lt;- dataset[c(-3,-5), c(1:10)]
# would drop 3rd and 5th rows, and keep columns 1-10
```

---
# Subsetting example

Suppose I want to print first two rows of `gapminder`


```r
gapminder[c(1:2),]
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 × 6
##   country     continent  year lifeExp     pop gdpPercap
##   &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;int&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 Afghanistan Asia       1952    28.8 8425333      779.
## 2 Afghanistan Asia       1957    30.3 9240934      821.
```

Or remove first row and sixth column and save it as a new object


```r
gapminder_subset &lt;- gapminder[-1, -6]
```

---
# Subsetting practice

&gt; **Type a heading the same level as select titled, "Subsetting"**

&gt; **Start a new code chunk and name it subset.**

--

&gt; **Print only the first row and all columns of `gapminder`**

--

&gt; **Save a new dataset named `gap_subset` where you remove the first, ninth, and thirteenth rows, and keep columns 1-4**

--

&gt; **Knit to HTML**

---
# Mutate

![](labs_files/mutate.png)

- Generic syntax


```r
dataset &lt;- mutate(dataset, new_var = some_math_function)
```

- Only a single `=` is used because we are assigning value

- If `new_var` is the name of an existing variable, `mutate` will overwrite it according to your equation

- Otherwise, `mutate` will add a new variable to the dataset

---
# Mutate examples

Print table with `pop`ulation rescaled from ones to millions


```r
mutate(gapminder, pop = pop/1000000)
```

--

Print table with new variable `pop_millions` that rescales `pop` to millions


```r
mutate(gapminder, pop_millions = pop/1000000)
```

--

Save new dataset with a variable equal to global, all-time life expectancy


```r
gapminder2 &lt;- mutate(gapminder, avg_lifeExp = mean(lifeExp))
```

---
# Mutate examples

Save new dataset with new variable equal to how much above/below country is from `avg_lifeExp`


```r
gapminder3 &lt;- mutate(gapminder2, 
                     deviation_lifeExp = lifeExp - avg_lifeExp)
#or
gapminder3 &lt;- mutate(gapminder, 
                     deviation_lifeExp = lifeExp - mean(lifeExp))
```

--

Can create multiple variables at a time


```r
gapminder3 &lt;- mutate(gapminder,
                     pop_millions = pop/1000000,
                     avg_lifeExp = mean(lifeExp),
                     deviation_lifeExp = lifeExp - avg_lifeExp)
```

---
# Practice

&gt; **Type a heading titled Mutate. Start a new code chunk and name it mutate.**

--

&gt; **Create a new dataset `gapminder07` containing only observations in 2007**

--

&gt; **On a new line, overwrite `gapminder07`, creating a new variable `gdp` equal to each country's GDP**

--

&gt; **In the *same* mutate function, create `global_gdp` equal to the `sum()` of all `gdp`s.**

--

&gt; **In the *same* mutate function, create `pct_gdp` equal to each country's percent of `global_gdp`.**

--

&gt; **Using `gapminder07` print a table containing only observations where `pct_gdp` is greater than or equal to 10. Knit to HTML**

---
# Arrange

![](labs_files/arrange.png)

- Generic syntax


```r
arrange(data_set, var)
# Where var is the variable on which you want to arrange
# Arranges in ascending order by default

arrange(data_set, desc(var))
# Arranges in descending order
```

- Helpful for printing tables to see highest or lowest cases

---
# Arrange examples

Print countries arranged in ascending order of life expectancy (low-to-high)


```r
arrange(gapminder, lifeExp)
```

--

Print countries arranged in descending order of life expectancy (high-to-low)


```r
arrange(gapminder, desc(lifeExp))
```

---
# Arrange practice

&gt; **Type a heading titled Arrange. Start a new code chunk and name it arrange.**

--

&gt; **Using `gapminder07`, print a table that lists countries in descending order according to `pct_gdp`**

&gt; **Knit to HTML**

---
class: inverse, middle, center

# Combining Wrangle Verbs

---
# Pipe operator %&gt;%

- Allows us to run multiple commands, sequentially feeding the result of the previous line of code to the next

- Makes code easier to read and write

- Keyboard shortcut is Cmd+Shift+M

.pull-left[

Prints the result


```r
dataset %&gt;% 
  filter(some criteria) %&gt;% 
  select(some vars) %&gt;% 
  mutate(new_var) %&gt;% 
  arrange(var)
```
]

.pull-right[

Saves the result


```r
dataset &lt;- dataset %&gt;% 
  filter(some criteria) %&gt;% 
  select(some vars) %&gt;% 
  mutate(new_var) %&gt;% 
  arrange(var)
```
]

---
# Pipe example

Suppose I wanted to print a table of the top five countries with respect to percent of global GDP in 2007. Without piping:


```r
gapminder07 &lt;- filter(gapminder, year == 2007)

gapminder07 &lt;- mutate(gapminder07, 
                     gdp = gdpPercap*pop,
                     global_gdp = sum(gdp),
                     pct_gdp = (gdp/global_gdp)*100)

gdp_table &lt;- select(gapminder07, country, pct_gdp)
gdp_table &lt;- arrange(gdp_table, desc(pct_gdp))

slice_head(gdp_table, n = 5)
```

---
# Pipe example

To print same table with piping:


```r
gapminder %&gt;% 
  filter(year == 2007) %&gt;% 
  mutate(gdp = gdpPercap*pop,
         global_gdp = sum(gdp),
         pct_gdp = (gdp/global_gdp)*100) %&gt;% 
  select(country, pct_gdp) %&gt;% 
  arrange(desc(pct_gdp)) %&gt;% 
  slice_head(n=5)
```

- Don't have to keep specifying the dataset inside each verb

- Don't have to save the result each step of the way; no `gapminder07` or `gdp_table` needed.

- Easier to follow

---
# Pipe practice

&gt; **Add a heading "Pipe Operator"**

&gt; **Start a new code chunk and name it pipe.**

--

&gt; **Use the pipe operator to efficiently save a new dataset `gapminder52` that contains only 1952 observations and the GDP variables we created earlier (copy and paste is your friend)**

--

&gt; **On a new line, use piping to print a table of `gapminder52` that includes only `country` and `pct_gdp`, arranged in descending order and only the top 5 countries.**

--

&gt; **Knit to HTML**

---
# Kable options for tables

- The `kable()` function, part of the `knitr` package, is a quick way to format tables.

- Three useful options:
  - digits = # sets the number of digits to the right of the decimal
  - col.names = renames the columns
  - caption = provides a table title

---
# Kable example

&gt; **Add a heading "Kable Table"**

&gt; **Start a new code chunk and name it kable. Add the following code.**


```r
gapminder52 %&gt;% 
  select(country, pct_global_gdp) %&gt;% 
  arrange(desc(pct_global_gdp)) %&gt;% 
  slice_head(n=5) %&gt;% 
  kable(digits = 1,
        col.names = c('Country', 'Percent of Global GDP'),
        caption = 'Largest Economies in 1952')
```

&gt; **Knit to HTML.**

---

# Summarize &amp; Group By

---
# Summarize

![](labs_files/summarize.png)

- Generic syntax


```r
summarize(data_set, "Name of column" = function(variable),
          "Name of column" = function(variable),...)
```

- Where `function` is one of many possible summary functions (see data transformation cheatsheet)

- Useful for quickly reporting a few summary stats in a nicely formatted table

---
# Summarize example

Suppose I want to report median life expectancy and GDP per capita in 2007


```r
gapminder %&gt;% 
  filter(year == 2007) %&gt;% 
  summarize('Median Life Expectancy' = median(lifeExp),
            'Median GDP per Capita' = median(gdpPercap)) %&gt;% 
  kable(digits = 0,
        format.args = list(big.mark = ',')) # Inserts commas
```


| Median Life Expectancy| Median GDP per Capita|
|----------------------:|---------------------:|
|                     72|                 6,124|

---
# Summarize practice

&gt; **Add a heading "Summarize"**

&gt; **Start a new code chunk and name it summarize**

&gt; **Summarize `gapminder52` into a table that reports the `min`imum, `median`, and `max`imum percentages of global GDP in 1952.**

---
# Group By

![](labs_files/group_by.png)

- General syntax


```r
data_set %&gt;% 
  group_by(grouping_variable) %&gt;% 
  summarize(name = function(variable))
```

- Year and any nominal variable are common grouping variables

---
# Group by example

Median life expectancy and GDP per capita in 2007 *by continent*


```r
gapminder %&gt;% 
  filter(year == 2007) %&gt;% 
* group_by(continent) %&gt;%
  summarize('Median Life Expectancy' = median(lifeExp),
            'Median GDP per Capita' = median(gdpPercap)) %&gt;% 
  kable(digits = 0, format.args = list(big.mark = ','))
```


|continent | Median Life Expectancy| Median GDP per Capita|
|:---------|----------------------:|---------------------:|
|Africa    |                     53|                 1,452|
|Americas  |                     73|                 8,948|
|Asia      |                     72|                 4,471|
|Europe    |                     79|                28,054|
|Oceania   |                     81|                29,810|

---
# Group by practice

&gt; **Add a heading "Group By"**

&gt; **Start a new code chunk and name it groupby.**

&gt; **Produce a table that reports the `min`imum, `median`, and `max`imum percentages of global GDP by each year included in `gapminder`.**

&gt; **Knit to HTML**
