# Course Objectives

![](Intro_Slides_files/proco.png)

&lt;br&gt;

- Both sides need to communicate

- We are always consuming statistics

- Producing helps you be a more conscientious consumer

---
class: inverse, center, middle

# My objective is to help make you as competitive as possible in your respective job markets by being competent in statistics and statistical software.

---

# Why learn R

- Adams, et al. (2013) Statistical Software for Curriculum and Careers. Journal of Public Affairs Education.

  - 80% of MPA schools use stats software besides Excel
  
  - 30% of public sector jobs asked for (at least) familiarity with stats software besides Excel

--

- R is dominant in data science

- Learning R is harder but more generalizable

- R is free

---

# Why statistics

- Data is the raw material of knowledge

--

- Statistics is the most powerful tool we have to convert raw information into something useful

--

- Competency in statistics helps us be better thinkers in all areas of life because a lot of key concepts are not strictly mathematical

---
class: inverse, center, middle

# Let's consider an example how statistics can help us think more good

# Planes and bullet holes

![:scale 75%](Intro_Slides_files/plane.png)

Suppose we had 100 pounds/kg of armor to add to each plane. How would you explain the best way to distribute that armor around the plane?

# Assignments

---
class: inverse, middle, center

# RLab1: Introduction to R and R Workflow

---

# Starting R

- You need to have R and RStudio installed on your computer

- Launch RStudio

- Get your bearings

---

# File Directory

- Type `getwd()` into the console (bottom-left pane) and hit `Enter`

- When you tell R to look for or save a file, this is the location R uses

---
# R Projects

## R Projects are the best way to organize your work in R

- I will show you how to create an R Project

- Our objective is to create a project called `RLAB1` in a file location of our choice

- You can find plenty of instruction on the web (including our textbooks) if you forget how

---
# Opening data already formatted for R

- Download the file titled `states1.RData` on eLC. Leave it wherever your computer saved it (probably your `Downloads` folder)

- Type `load(states1.RData)` in the console and hit `Enter`

--

- Error in load(states1.RData) : object 'states1.RData' not found
Calls: &lt;Anonymous&gt; ... withCallingHandlers -&gt; withVisible -&gt; eval -&gt; eval -&gt; load
Execution halted

- What is wrong?

--

- Remember, R looks for files in your project folder

- You can include the file path `load(folder/folder/states1.RData)`

- Or you can move the file to your project folder and the previous code should work

---
# Starting a document

- RStudio can output several types of files
  - PDF
  - Word
  - HTML for websites or files that open in your browser

--

- Any of the above start with editing one of several R documents
  - Script - bare bones to run code
  - RMarkdown - allows to make all sorts of things [video](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html)
  - Notebook - same as RMarkdown but interactive so we can run code and see results in real-time.
  
---

# Scripts

- Open a script

- If all you need is run some code without caring a finished document, use scripts

- Scripts support two elements:
  - Code
  - Comments
  - Use a hashtag `#` so R knows what is a comment
  

```r
# This is a comment. Below is an arbitrary formula.
((5+5)/2)^2
```

```
## [1] 25
```

---
# Objects

- Objects are anything you tell R to temporarily save during a session. The environment pane keeps a list of all objects. Think of objects as different sheets in an Excel file--each sheet can be anything you want. 

- You should already have an object `states1`

- Let's create another object using the code below


```r
x &lt;- ((5+5)/2)^2
```

- The `&lt;-` symbol is called the assignment operator. It tells R to save the result of the thing on the right side as the name on the left side.

- The keyboard shortcut for the assignment is `Alt-` on PC or `Option-` on Mac. Speaking of keyboard shortcuts...

---
# Why save an object?

- We create an object whenever we want to use something for later or save it as a file.

- Suppose `x` is *super* interesting but your boss wants to know what `x` is squared.

- You don't need to recreate `x`. You can just square `x`.


```r
x^2
```

```
## [1] 625
```


```r
xsquared &lt;- x^2
```


```r
xsquared
```

```
## [1] 625
```

---
# R Notebook

- We will use notebooks in this class

- Start a notebook--the template is informative

- The R Markdown cheatsheet is more informative
  - Go to Help-&gt;Cheatsheets-&gt;R Markdown Cheat Sheet
  
- Let's add a few headers to the template

---
# Knitting a notebook

- Knit the template to HTML

- Name the notebook `test`

- You should see two new files in your `files` pane (bottom-right) titled `test.Rmd` and `test.html`.

---
# YAML header

- The YAML header tell R how to format the output

- Change the YAML to the following


```r
---
title:  'Test'
author: 'Your Name'
output:
  html_document: default
  word_document: default
---
```

- Knit the `test` notebook to Word

- Knit the `test` notebook to PDF

- Which do you like more?

---
# Making the Word output look a little better

- Download the file titled `rlabs_styledoc.docx` to your project folder

- Change the YAML of your notebook


```r
title:  'Test'
author: 'Your Name'
output:
  html_document: default
  word_document: 
    reference_docx: rlabs_styledoc.docx
```

- Knit to Word again

---
# So what?

- Now you have the option to produce output in Word or PDF

- Use one of these for every RLab

- If you prefer Word, use the above YAML everytime

---
class: inverse, middle, center

# Let's create our first RLab notebook and post on eLC

---
# RLAB1 Notebook

- Download the file `RLab1_Profile` on eLC and add to your `RLab1` project folder

- Complete the instructions in the `RLab1_Profile` until you reach the competencies section

---
# Competencies

The National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration (NASSPA) promotes six competencies in methods. Rate yourself on these competencies using the following scale:

1. Not familiar enough with the topic to rate myself
2. I have some competency but need improvement to achieve professional goals
3. Do not need improvement to achieve professional goals
4. Not to brag, but I'm basically an expert

---
# Adding code chunks

- Add a code chunk that executes some basic arithmetic

- Save the result to an object called `math`

---
# Packages

R loads with a lot of base functionality, but some things we want to do requires us to install or load additional packages into our R session. A package is simply a set of functions that augments the base functionality of R.

&gt; Very important: Your notebook won't knit if you use code that requires a package that you haven't loaded inside of your notebook.

--

- Try this code:


```r
kable(states1)
```

Error in kable(states1) : could not find function "kable"

---
# Loading packages

To load a package, it has to be installed on your computer. You only need to install a package once.

- Let's install the `knitr` package that contains the `kable` function

- Execute the following code in your **console**


```r
install.packages(kable)
```

- Once installed, now we can load a package. Add this code to your notebook.


```r
library(knitr)
```

---
# Printing a table

- Add another code chunk

- Load the `states1` data


```r
load("states1.RData")
```

- Now try knitting to HTML

---
# Knitting in order

&gt; Your notebook knits in the order of your code chunks. If you use a function on data that you load **below** the function, it's the same as not having the data loaded.

&gt; If a code chunk depends on another chunk, then the latter needs to be done before the former.

- Copy-and-paste the `load` chunk above the `kable` chunk.

- Knit to HTML again. Does it work?

---
# Posting to eLC

- eLC's discussion boards does not play well with HTML, so you will need to post RLabs using Word or PDF

- Knit your notebook to Word or PDF

- Post the .docx or .pdf file to the RLab1 discussion forum
