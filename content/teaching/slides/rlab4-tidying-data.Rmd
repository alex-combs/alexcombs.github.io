# Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will have learned how to...

- Pivot a wide dataset to long
- Pivot a long dataset to wide
- Separate a variable into multiple variables
- Unite multiple variables to one variable

---
# Start a new project

- Using the file directory on your computer
  - Go to the parent folder that contains your RLabs folders
  - Create a new folder named RLab4

--

- In RStudio
  - Create new project
  - Select Existing Directory
  - Click Browse and select the RLab4 folder you just created
  - Click Create Project
  
---
# Start a R notebook

- Use the dropdown menu in the upper-left of RStudio to start a notebook

- Change YAML

```{r, eval=FALSE}

  html_document:

```

- Delete all of the content included in the template

---
# Packages

- Load the `tidyverse` package, suppressing the code and output

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(gapminder)
```

---
# Tidy data

Tidy data satisfy three rules:

- Each variable has its own column
- Each observation (unit of analysis) has its own row
- Each value (datum) has its own cell

![](labs_files/tidy.png)

---
# Tidy data

- Let's revisit the state finance data from RLab3

- Insert a header "Untidy State Finance Data"

- `load` the `stf_f_select.RData` file in your notebook, suppressing the code and and output

```{r, include=FALSE}
load('labs_files/stf_f_select.RData')
```

---
# Tidy Data

- Let's show readers a sample of the data

- Provide the first 4 rows, suppressing the code

```{r, echo=FALSE}
stf_f_select %>% 
  head(n = 4) %>% 
  kable()
```

---
class: inverse, center, middle

# Are these data tidy? Why or why not?

---
# Untidy Data

```{r, echo=FALSE}
stf_f_select %>% 
  head(n=4) %>% 
  kable()
```

- What is the unit of analysis?

--

- There are two rows per observation (unit of analysis)

--

- Why?

--

- Because `finance_type` should be two variables, not one

---
# Long vs. Wide Data

- Most tidying issues involve whether a dataset should be long or wide

--

- Is `stf_f_select` in long or wide format?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
stf_f_select %>% 
  head(n=4) %>% 
  kable()
```

---
# Long vs. Wide Data

- Here is a different example that is very common.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
uspop <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(country == 'United States' & year >= 1997) %>% 
  select(country, year, pop) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, names_prefix = 'pop', values_from = pop) 

 
kable(uspop, format = 'html')
```

- Are these data in long or wide format?

--

- Are these data tidy? Why or why not?

---
# Tidy State Finance Data

- Our goal is to tidy `stf_f_select`

- It is long when it should be wide

--

- To achieve this, we can use the `pivot_wider` function

- General syntax

```{r, eval=FALSE}
new_data <- current_data %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = column-with-variable-names,
              values_from = column-with-values)
```

---
# Tidy State Finance Data

```{r, echo=FALSE}
stf_f_select %>% 
  head(n=2) %>% 
  kable()
```

- Insert a header "Tidy State Finance Data"

- Let's start a code chunk that creates a new dataset `stf_tidy`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
stf_tidy <- stf_f_select %>% 
```

- Next, add a line that drops `finance_source` since it is redundant

```{r, include=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
stf_tidy <- stf_f_select %>% 
  select(-finance_source) %>% 
```

---
# Tidy State Finance Data

```{r, echo=FALSE}
stf_f_select %>% 
  head(n=4) %>% 
  kable()
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
new_data <- current_data %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = column-with-variable-names,
              values_from = column-with-values)
```

- Which column contains the names of the new variables we want?
- Which column contains the values for the new variables?
- Add `pivot_wider` to your code chunk according to answers.

---
# Tidy State Finance Data

```{r}
stf_tidy <- stf_f_select %>% 
  select(-finance_source) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = finance_type,
              values_from = amount_1000)
```

- Execute your code and examine the new dataset to see if/how it worked

---
# Tidy State Finance Data

- Provide the reader with top 4 rows of the new dataset, suppress code

```{r, echo=FALSE}
stf_tidy %>% 
  head() %>% 
  kable()
```

---
# Wide to Long

```{r, echo=FALSE}
kable(uspop, format = 'html')
```

- To tidy wide data to long format, we can use `pivot_longer`

```{r}
uspop_tidy <- uspop %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = pop1997:pop2007,
               names_to = 'year',
               names_prefix = 'pop',
               values_to = 'population')
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
kable(uspop_tidy)
```

---
# Untidy Enrollment Data

- Download the `ky_private_school_enrollment.csv` file from eLC and add to your project folder

- Open this file using whatever spreadsheet software is on your computer

---
# Untidy Enrollment Data

- Insert a header "Untidy Enrollment Data"

- Import `ky_private_school_enrollment.csv`, suppressing code and output

- Name the new dataset `ky_priv_enroll_wide`

```{r, include=FALSE}
ky_priv_enroll_wide <- read_csv('labs_files/ky_private_school_enrollment.csv')
```

---
# Untidy Enrollment Data

- Provide the reader the first 3 rows of these data, suppressing the code

```{r, echo=FALSE}
head(ky_priv_enroll_wide, n=3) %>% 
  kable()
```

---
# Untidy Enrollment Data

- We need to take the `enrollyear` columns and name them to a new variable `year` and send the values to a variable we will name `enrollment`

- Recall how this was done for the `uspop` data

```{r, eval=FALSE}
uspop_tidy <- uspop %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = pop1997:pop2007,
               names_to = 'year',
               names_prefix = 'pop',
               values_to = 'population')
```

- Create a new dataset called `ky_priv_enroll` that is in long format

```{r, include=FALSE}
ky_priv_enroll <- ky_priv_enroll_wide %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = enroll2000:enroll2010,
               names_to = 'year',
               names_prefix = 'enroll',
               values_to = 'enrollment')
```

---
class: inverse, center, middle

# Are these data tidy? Why or why not?

---
# Separating variables

![](labs_files/separate.png)

---
# Tidy Enrollment Data

- We should `separate` city_county into city and county

- Overwrite the `ky_priv_enroll` with `city_county` separated, suppressing code and output

--

```{r, warning=FALSE}
ky_priv_enroll <- ky_priv_enroll %>% 
  separate(city_county, c('city', 'county'))
```

--

- Finally, provide the reader the first 6 rows of these tidy data, suppressing the code

- Knit to HTML and check that the output looks correct
