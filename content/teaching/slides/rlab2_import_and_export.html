# Objectives

- Import data

  - included in a R package
  - csv and Excel
  - directly from url
  
- Export R Markdown

  - change YAML to print nicer tables
  - to Word and PDF
  - suppress code and/or results

- Export data to csv



---
# Set-up

.pull-left[

&gt; **If using RStudio Cloud, do not create a new project. Instead, use the project you created for RLab1 where you already installed `tidyverse`. Installed packages do not carry over to other project spaces.**

]

.pull-right[

&gt; **Otherwise, create a new project named "rlab2". I recommend locating it in the same parent file as your rlab1 project folder.**

]

---
# Set-up

&gt; **Start a R Markdown document**

&gt; **Change the title in the YAML to "RLab2: Import &amp; Export"**

&gt; **Keep the setup code chunk at the top but delete the rest of the template.**

---
# Set-up: packages

- Remember that a package will not load if it is not installed.

--

&gt; **In the setup code chunk at the top, use the code below to load the following packages.**


```r
library(tidyverse) #includes function for importing CSV
library(readxl) #for importing Excel files
library(data.table) #for importing from URL
library(gapminder) #contains data we need to use
library(fivethirtyeight) #contains data we need to use
```

- If you receive error message "package does not exist," you need to install it.

- We will wait until all students have necessary packages loaded. For those waiting, please be patient.

---
# Set-up: files

&gt; **Download "ncbirths" from eLC and add it to your current project folder**

&gt; **Download "ga_schdist_raw" from eLC and add to your "rlab2" project folder.**

---

# Data imports

---
# Data in R Packages

- Many R packages, like `gapminder` and `fivethirtyeight` include datasets

- We can browse datasets by going to the "Packages" tab in the bottom-right pane of RStudio
  - Click on the package that contains the relevant dataset
  - A list of datasets will appear
  - Click on a dataset to learn more about it

---
# Data in R Packages

&gt; **In a new code chunk, add and run the following**


```r
# slice_head() prints row(s) from the top of a dataset
# n=4 tells it to print the top 4 rows
slice_head(gapminder, n=4)
```


|country     |continent | year| lifeExp|      pop| gdpPercap|
|:-----------|:---------|----:|-------:|--------:|---------:|
|Afghanistan |Asia      | 1952|  28.801|  8425333|  779.4453|
|Afghanistan |Asia      | 1957|  30.332|  9240934|  820.8530|
|Afghanistan |Asia      | 1962|  31.997| 10267083|  853.1007|
|Afghanistan |Asia      | 1967|  34.020| 11537966|  836.1971|

- This is one way to provide a preview of the data for a reader

---
# Data in R Packages

&gt; **Change the code so it saves as an object named `gap_preview` like so and run again**


```r
gap_preview &lt;- slice_head(gapminder, n=4)
```

- You should now see an object named `gap_preview` in your environment (top-right pane)

---
# Printing the result

- Note that the table does not print when you run the code

- By default, R does not print the result when saved as an object

--

&gt; **Type `gap_preview` on a separate line so the table prints when knit**


```r
gap_preview &lt;- slice_head(gapminder, n=4)

*gap_preview
```

---
# Data in R Packages

- There is a dataset named `hate_crimes` contained within the `fivethirtyeight` package.

--

&gt; **Insert a new code chunk and add the following code**


```r
hc &lt;- hate_crimes
```

- Now we have a copy of `hate_crimes` in our environment

---
# Data in R Packages

&gt; **Start a new line in the code chunk you just created.**

&gt; **Add code that will print the first six rows of the `hc` dataset.**

&gt; **Knit to HTML**

---
class: inverse, middle, center

# Printing tables.

---
# Printing tables

- We have made two tables that will print when we knit using the code:


```r
gap_preview
slice_head(hc, n=4)
```

- There is enough horizontal space for all `gap_preview` variables to display but not for all `hc` variables

---
# Printing tables

- We can improve how all tables print

&gt; **Change the YAML to the following:**


```r
---
title: "RLab2: Import &amp; Export"
author: "Alex Combs"
*output: #no space after colon
* html_document: #tab indent
*   df_print: kable #tab indent
---
```

&gt; **Knit to HTML**

- The `gap_preview` table should look better but the `hc` table still runs off the page.

---
# Printing tables

&gt; **Change the `df_print` option in your YAML like so:**


```r
---
title: "RLab2: Import &amp; Export"
author: "Alex Combs"
output:
  html_document:
*   df_print: paged
---
```

&gt; **Knit to HTML**

- Now we can interact with the `hc` table to view multiple pages of variables.

---
# YAML themes

- Several [themes](https://bootswatch.com/3/) available to change the appearance of your HTML output

&gt; **Add the highlighted lines to your YAML, then knit to HTML**


```r
---
title: "RLab2: Import &amp; Export"
author: "Alex Combs"
output:
  html_document:
    df_print: paged
*   theme: spacelab
*   highlight: tango
---
```

- More info on formatting HTML [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html#appearance-and-style) if interested

# Code chunk options.

---
# Code chunk options

- Can control how code knits using code chunk options

--

- Include options by adding a comma after the `r`, followed by a space


```r
{r, options_go_here}
```

--

- echo = TRUE/FALSE 
  - Suppresses the code from the output but shows results
  

```r
{r, echo=FALSE}
```

--

- include = TRUE/FALSE
  - Suppress the code AND all results from the output


```r
{r, include=FALSE}
```

---
# Code chunk options

&gt; **Find the code chunk that prints the `gap_preview` table**

--

&gt; **Add the code chunk option that suppresses the code AND results**

--

&gt; **Find the code chunk that prints the first four rows of `hc`**

--

&gt; **Add the code chunk option that suppresses ONLY the code**

--

&gt; **Knit to HTML**

---
# Output options overview

![](labs_files/output_options.png)

- The minus signs indicate what each option suppresses

---
# Global code chunk option

- When you start a new Rmd template, it contains a code chunk near the top named "setup" that contains


```r
{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

--

- This sets `echo=TRUE` for all code chunks by default

- If you change to `echo=FALSE`, all code chunks will be suppressed by default when you knit.

--

- You can also add `message=FALSE` and `warning=FALSE` to suppress the background information RStudio communicates to you but typically should not be included in knitted document

# Back to data imports

---
# Importing data

- Organizations publish data files in a variety of (inconvenient) formats and tend to use a consistent format across files and time

- Provides the opportunity to use code to import many similar files quickly

--

- Messy data files present a fork in our workflow
  - Clean the data some as part of the import, or
  - Import data as is and clean later

- Which is more efficient depends on the dataset

--

- Avoid changing the data files in something like Excel before importing it because you or others can't replicate that

---
# Importing CSV

- Generic syntax:


```r
any_name &lt;- read_csv("filename.csv")
```

- Tells R to import the `"filename.csv"`, naming it whatever we type on the left side

- Remember:
  - Quotes around the file
  - Include the file extension .csv

---
# Importing Excel

- Generic syntax:


```r
anyname &lt;- read_excel("filename.xlsx")
```

- Works with both .xls or .xlsx extensions

---
# Preserve or Clean on Import

- The previous two slides provide all the code needed to import the two most common public data file formats without cleaning the data. 

- If we want to clean the data on import, the best approach for new users is the import window/wizard RStudio provides.

- We will now cover some cleaning we can do with this second option

---
# Importing data

&gt; **In file pane, click on "ncbirths.csv", then "Import Dataset..."**

--

- Some notable features of this dataset:
  - Variable names are in the top row
  - Variable names are short

- This dataset should import nicely without needing additional changes

---
# Importing data

- Let's review some of the options we can use through this import window

--

- Can click on a variable to change how R stores it, or exclude it from the import

- Can change the name of the object R will save. Same name as file by default.

- Can skip some specified number of the top rows

- Can specify whether the top row includes variable names

---
# Importing data

- R provides the code needed to import the data based on the options we chose

- **We need to include this code in our R Markdown or else it won't knit if we have code that requires the data**

--

&gt; **Copy the code. Hit Cancel. Paste the code into a new code chunk.**

---
# Importing data

&gt; **Change the import code based on the following:**

  - We don't need the first line since we already loaded `tidyverse`
  - R uses the full file path, but we don't want to use that because others will have to change it
  - We don't want the last line `View` because it usually causes an error when knit

&gt; **Run the code to import the data**

---
# Importing data

- This point-and-click method is convenient if you don't know the packages and code needed to import, especially if options are needed.

- Can get you started for any kind of data file

- Has some limitations
  - Can't rename variables
  - Can't inspect bottom rows of a large dataset

---
# Importing data

- If we were to open "ga_schdist_raw.xlsx" with spreadsheet software like Excel, we would see this file has some undesirable qualities
  - At least first 6 rows should be skipped
  - Variable names are long (OK but inconvenient)
  - Row 231 may look like data we want to import but it is not. It contains summary information that does not belong in a data set where districts are the unit of analysis.
  - Additional rows at the bottom that do not contain data

--

- The information we want to import from "ga_schdist_raw.xlsx" runs from cell A7 to cell I230
- Or A8 to I230 if we want to skip the long variable names

---
# Importing data

&gt; **In RStudio, click on "ga_schdist_raw.xlsx" in the file pane, then "Import Dataset..."**

--

&gt; **Notice there is a "Range" option in the bottom left. Enter `A8:I230`.**

--

&gt; **Uncheck "First Row as Names" because row 8 contains data, not variable names.**

--

&gt; **There are numeric variables stored as character. Click on each and change to numeric using the dropdown menu.**

--

&gt; **Copy code and paste in the code chunk in your Rmd.**

---
# Importing data

&gt; **Delete the code we don't want like before (package load, full file path, and View).**

--

- Should look like below


```r
ga_schdist_raw &lt;- read_excel("ga_schdist_raw.xlsx", 
                             range = "A8:I230", 
                             col_names = FALSE, 
                             col_types = c("text", "text", "text", "numeric", "numeric", "numeric", "numeric", "numeric", "numeric"))
```

&gt; **Run this code to complete import.**

---
# Importing data

- You should have a new object `ga_schdist_raw` in your environment

&gt; **Click on `ga_schdist_raw` to view the data.**

--

- All that's missing now are variable names

---
# Importing data

- No variable names in our first import because `col_names = FALSE`


```r
ga_schdist_raw &lt;- read_excel("ga_schdist_raw.xlsx", 
                             range = "A8:I230", 
*                            col_names = FALSE,
                             col_types = c("text", "text", "text", "numeric", "numeric", "numeric", "numeric", "numeric", "numeric"))
```

---
# Importing data

&gt; **Replace `FALSE` with below code**


```r
c("district","state","charter","enroll","lep", "iep","frpl","white","expenditures")
```

--

&gt; **Code should now look like below. If so, run it again to update import.**


```r
ga_schdist_raw &lt;- read_xlsx("labs_files/ga_schdist_raw.xlsx", 
                            range = "A8:I230",
                            col_names =  c("district","state","charter","enroll","lep", "iep","frpl","white","expenditures"))
```

---
# Importing Data

- High initial cost, but now anyone using the same data file can run this code to get a clean import.

- Can also use code to import the same data for different time periods. Just change the file name accordingly.

---
# Import from URL

-  If data updates frequently, we don't want to download a new version every time.

- If a large dataset is publicly available, we don't want to save it to our computer.

- Lots of data are saved to the web and accessible via a url. We can import directly from the url.

---
# Import from URL

- General syntax (requires the data.table package):


```r
anyname &lt;- fread('url') 
```

---
# Import from URL

[Coronavirus case count](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html)

- New York Times made the data publicly available on GitHub

[Data repository](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data)

- The url for the raw state-level data is [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-states.csv)

--

&gt; **Use the `fread()` function to import state Coronavirus data linked above.**



--

&gt; **Set eval=FALSE so the data does not load every time we knit.**

---

# Exporting to Word and PDF

---
# Knit to Word

- If Word is installed on your computer, knitting to Word should work

&gt; **In the Knit dropdown menu, select "Knit to Word"**

- Then you can improve the formatting using Word

---
# Knit to PDF

- In order to knit to PDF, your computer needs a copy of a program called LaTeX

- If you want, you can install a light version of LaTeX within RStudio. 


```r
# In the console pane, type
install.packages('tinytex') # hit Enter
# Next, in the console pane, type
tinytex::install_tinytex() # hit Enter
```

---
# Knit to PDF

- There are packages you can download that offer templates that will format your PDFs into research papers or reports so you don't have to learn LaTeX formatting.

- If interested, check out
  - [rticles](https://github.com/rstudio/rticles)
  - `install.packages("stevetemplates")`

---
class: inverse, center, middle

# Exporting data to CSV

---
# Export data to CSV

- We may want to export data in our environment that we have prepared in RStudio for others to use

- Generic syntax for exporting data to CSV:


```r
write_csv(name_of_object_in_environment, 'name_for_new_file.csv')
```

--

&gt; **Export the `ga_schdist_raw` object to a csv file. Name the file "ga_schdist_clean"**

---
# Recap

- Over past two weeks...

- Launch RStudio -&gt; load packages &amp; import data needed to do analysis -&gt; knit to document -&gt; save documents and data for later use

- This covers the general workflow of realistically using RStudio 

- Now just need to add skills that take us from import to desired export

---
# Upload to eLC

- Upload your Rmd to the RLab assignment dropbox on eLC.
