# Objectives

- Learn to perform two most common tasks for combining data

  - Append
  - Left join

---

# Setup

- For this lab, we will add to the work we did for RLab5 on data visualizations.

> Instead of starting a new project, open your RLab5 project by clicking on the file with extension .Rproj or just open your Rmd file.

> **Consider changing YAML to:**

```{r, eval=FALSE}

# Setup

> **Reload the packages that should already be in your Rmd:**

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(data.table)
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(data.table)
library(tidyverse)

covid <- fread('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-counties-2022.csv')

covid_ga <- covid %>% 
  filter(state == 'Georgia')

#covid_ga$date <- ymd(covid_ga$date)

yesterday <- '2022-10-16'

#covid_ga$county <- as.factor(covid_ga$county)
```

---
# Download & Import Data

> **Download the `st_fin_2014.csv`, `st_fin_2015.csv`, `st_fin_2016.csv`, and `ga_county_pop.csv` files from eLC and add them to your project folder.**

> **In your setup code chunk, import the four data files.**

```{r, eval=FALSE}
st_fin_2014 <- 
st_fin_2015 <- 
st_fin_2016 <- 
ga_county_pop <- 
```

```{r, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
st_fin_14 <- read_csv("st_fin_2014.csv")
st_fin_15 <- read_csv("st_fin_2015.csv")
st_fin_16 <- read_csv("st_fin_2016.csv")
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
st_fin_2014 <- read_csv("labs_files/st_fin_2014.csv")
st_fin_2015 <- read_csv("labs_files/st_fin_2015.csv")
st_fin_2016 <- read_csv("labs_files/st_fin_2016.csv")
```

# Append

- Stacking observations among two or more datasets with **identical** layout. 

- Example: Adding multiple time periods together of the same data that is released annually.

![:scale 50%](labs_files/append.png)


---
# Append Example

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(gapminder)

gapminder07 <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  select(country, year, gdpPercap)

gapminder02 <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2002) %>% 
  select(country, year, gdpPercap)

gapminder97 <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 1997) %>% 
  select(country, year, gdpPercap)
```

- Suppose I need to append three datasets with same layout

--

```{r}
glimpse(gapminder07)
glimpse(gapminder02)
```

---
# Append Example

```{r}
glimpse(gapminder97)
```

---
# Append Example

- To append, all we need to do is `bind` the `rows` of each dataset using the `bind_rows` function

- General syntax

```{r, eval=FALSE}
new_dataset <- bind_rows(dataset1, dataset2, ...)
```

---
# Append Example

```{r}
gapminder97_07 <- bind_rows(gapminder97, gapminder02, gapminder07)

glimpse(gapminder97_07)
```

- There are now 426 rows in the new dataset (3 x 142)

---
# Append Practice

> **Immediately below your setup code chunk, insert a heading "Append"**

- You have three `st_fin_year` datasets with the same layout

> **Append them to create a new dataset `st_fin_2014_2016`**

```{r, include=FALSE}
st_fin_2014_2016 <- bind_rows(st_fin_2016, st_fin_2015, st_fin_2014)
```

---
# Append Practice

> **Start a new code chunk and use `glimpse` to confirm it worked**

```{r, eval=FALSE}
glimpse(st_fin_2014_2016)
```

- You should have 150 observations (3 years X 50 states)

- Now we can explore things like changes in state finances over time

---
class: inverse, middle, center

# Left joining data

---
# Where to add code

- Now we're ready to add data to the `covid_ga` data from the previous lab in order to make better comparisons across counties.

- We need to add code chunks that add these data *before* we start making graphs

> **Find the point in your Rmd where you finished preparing `covid_ga`. Run this code so `covid_ga` is in your environment** 

> **Add a new code chunk here or add to the existing code chunk.**

---
# Left Joins

- A left join is used when we want to add variables from a secondary dataset to our primary dataset, matching observations based on a common set of variables called the **key**

- Keeps **ALL** of the observations in our main dataset regardless of whether there is a match in the secondary dataset

- Observations in the secondary dataset that don't match with the main dataset **are not** added

![:scale 60%](labs_files/left_join.png)

---
# The Key to Joins/Merges

- The **key** is the variable or set of variables that uniquely identifies each observation/row that is shared across the datasets you want to join.

- If you can identify the unit of analysis in both datasets, you have identified the key to use for joins

- Datasets must have the same key in order to join them

- The key does not need to have the same variable name(s) across datasets

---
# General Syntax of Left Joins

- If a single variable is the key and named the same across datasets

```{r, eval=FALSE}
new_dataset <- name_of_left_dataset %>% 
  left_join(name_of_right_dataset, 
            by = "name_of_key")
```

--

-  If multiple variables of the same name are the key

```{r, eval=FALSE}
new_dataset <- name_of_left_dataset %>% 
  left_join(name_of_right_dataset, 
            by = c("name_of_key1", "name_of_key2", ...)) #<<
```

---
# General Syntax of Left Joins

- If one variable is the key and named differently across datasets

```{r, eval=FALSE}
new_dataset <- name_of_left_dataset %>% 
  left_join(name_of_right_dataset, 
            by = c("key_in_left_data" = "key_in_right_data")) #<<
```

--

- If multiple variables are the key and at least one is named differently

```{r, eval=FALSE}
new_dataset <- name_of_left_dataset %>% 
  left_join(name_of_right_dataset, 
            by = c("key_in_left_data" = "key_in_right_data", #<<
                   "common_key", ...)) #<<
```

---
# General Syntax to Left Joins

- Suppose I want to join several datasets to a main dataset. Some have same name for key and some don't.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
new_dataset <- name_of_left_dataset %>% 
  left_join(right1_dataset, by = "name_of_key") %>% 
  left_join(right2_dataset, by = c("key_in_left" = "key_in_right2")) %>% 
  left_join(right3_dataset, by = "name_of_key")
```

---
# Left Join Example

- Suppose I want to add population to the `gapminder97_07` that I appended earlier

```{r}
glimpse(gapminder97_07)
```

---
# Left Join Example

- Suppose I could find population data for only the U.S.

```{r, include=FALSE}
gap_pop_US <- gapminder %>% 
  select(country, year, pop) %>% 
  filter(country == "United States")
```

```{r}
glimpse(gap_pop_US)
```

- Note that there are only 12 observations in `gap_pop_US`, not 426 as in `gapminder97_07`

---
# Left Join Example

- First step is to identify the key(s) for `gapminder97_07` and `gap_pop_US`?

--

- `country` AND `year`
- They are named the same across both datasets as well, so...

--

```{r}
gap_pop_97_07 <- gapminder97_07 %>% 
  left_join(gap_pop_US, 
            by = c('country', 'year'))
glimpse(gap_pop_97_07)
```

---
# Left Join Practice

- You imported `ga_county_pop` earlier

- These data include total county population for 2019 from the US Census

```{r, include=FALSE}
ga_county_pop <- read_csv('labs_files/ga_county_pop.csv')
```

---
# Left Join Practice: What is the key

```{r}
glimpse(ga_county_pop)
glimpse(covid_ga)
```

---
# Variable Type Mismatch

- Before using a key to join data, make sure they are stored as the same type of variable in both datasets

- The glimpse output tells us how each variable is stored. Is the key stored differently across the two datasets?

--

- For example, if `county` was stored as a factor variable in `covid_ga` and as a character variable in `ga_county_pop`, we could change county to factor in `ga_county_pop` like so.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ga_county_pop$county <- as.factor(ga_county_pop$county)
```

---
# Left Join Practice

> **Now we are ready to join `ga_county_pop` to `covid_ga`. Give it a shot. Overwrite `covid_ga` instead of creating a new dataset.**

```{r, include=FALSE}
covid_ga <- covid_ga %>% 
  left_join(ga_county_pop, by = 'county')
```

> **Use `glimpse` on our updated dataset**

```{r}
glimpse(covid_ga)
```

---
# Recap

- In one chunk of code, we had R merge each county's population to all of the rows for that county in our COVID data

- We are now ready to compute normalized rates and visualize comparisons

- We will continue this project in the next lab

> **Upload your Rmd to eLC.**

# Other types of joins

- Inner join keeps only observations where the key matches

![:scale 65%](labs_files/inner_join.png)

- Replace `left_join` with `inner_join` in any of the previous examples

---
# Other types of joins

- Full join keeps all observations in both datasets regardless of match

![](labs_files/full_join.png)

- Replace `left_join` with `full_join` in any of the examples
