# PADP 7120 Data Applications in PA

# Outline

- Distinguish between descriptive and inferential statistics

- Identify population, sample, parameter, and statistic

- Distributions and their description



---
# Two types of statistics

.center[
![](lectures_files/stats_types.png)
]

---
# Descriptive vs. inferential

- Suppose we survey 100 alumni 2 years after completing their MPA to examine employment and earnings outcomes.

.pull-left[
**Descriptive**

- What is the average income of respondents?
- What percentage of respondents are employed?
- What percentage earn more than they did prior to starting MPA?

]

--

.pull-right[
**Inferential**

- What is the average income for MPA grads 2 years after graduation?
- Does getting an MPA increase the likelihood of being employed?
- Does getting an MPA increase income?
]

---
# Descriptive vs. inferential

Suppose we are told the average salary of college-educated women in Georgia is greater than the national average for all college-educated women, suggesting a college degree provides a better return on investment for women in Georgia than women in other states. Suppose we set out to investigate average salary in Georgia for ourselves. 

We take a sample of 100 college-educated women in Georgia and record the income of each.

--

- What is the unit of analysis in our dataset?
- What are the variables in our dataset?
- What is the population and sample for this study?
- What is the parameter and statistic/estimate for this study?

---
# Descriptive vs. inferential

Suppose we send a survey to all SPIA MPA alumni who graduated two years ago, asking about employment and earnings. Miraculously, we achieve a 100% response rate to the survey.

We calculate the average income of all SPIA MPA alumni who graduated two years ago.

--

- Is this value for average income a parameter or a statistic?

---
# Descriptive vs. inferential

Suppose we want to estimate the percentage of Athens residents who have a valid ID for the next election. We set up booths around UGA campus and ask people if they have a valid ID according to Georgia's election laws. We get 80 responses, and 80% said they have a valid ID.

--

- How might these 80 responses not represent a sample of the population?

---
class: inverse, middle, center

# Data description describes distributions.

---
# Describing numerical variables

- Center
  - Mean, median, mode
- Spread
  - Variance, standard deviation, IQR, range
- Association
  - Covariance, correlation, regression coefficient, coefficient of determination
  
---
# Affected measures

A city has a private high school and a public high school. Each year, all students take a state standardized test. Student scores can range between 0-100.

--

Suppose the student who will score the highest in the public school transfers to the private school.

--

What effect does this transfer have on the measures of center and spread for the public school's distribution of test scores?

---
# Affected measures

A city has a private high school and a public high school. Each year, all students take a state standardized test. Student scores can range between 0-100.

--

After hiring better teachers, the public school is able to raise the test scores of each of its students by 5 points.

--

What effect does this have on the measures of center and spread for the public school's distribution of test scores?

# Shapes of distributions

.pull-left[
- Private school
  - Mean: 80
  - Median: 80
  - Standard deviation: 5
  - Min: 65
  - Max: 100
  
- Public school
  - Mean: 70
  - Median: 80
  - Standard deviation: 12
  - Min: 25
  - Max: 100
]

.pull-right[
- What story do these numbers tell about test scores between the two schools?

# Choosing measures

]

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="Description_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

- Which measures of center and spread should we use or not use for the above distributions?

# Consider unit of analysis

- **Politician A:** The economy is awful! Thirty states had falling incomes last year.

- **Politician B:** Our economy is showing promising gains. Seventy percent of Americans had rising incomes last year.

- Which politician is lying?

---
# Consider unit of analysis

- Average class size vs. class size for average student

- Do the units of analysis differ?

--

- Does this change what would be reported?

---
# Consider unit of analysis

- Suppose PADP has only 5 classes with no student in more than 1 class. 4 classes have 5 students, and 1 class has 100 students

- Average class size

```r
(100 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5)/5
```

```
## [1] 24
```

--
  
- Class size experienced by average student


```r
(100*100+20*5)/120
```

```
## [1] 84.16667
```

---
# Center is only partial story

- An expensive new drug increases the median life expectancy among patients by one week. Insurance company decides not to cover what it deems an ineffective drug.

--

- Average test scores stay the same despite increase in spending.

---
# Correlation



.pull-left[
&lt;img src="Description_files/figure-html/q8.1-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="Description_files/figure-html/q8.2-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

- Units with higher values along the x-axis tend to have higher/lower values along the Y axis.

---
# Correlation

.pull-left[
&lt;img src="Description_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

.pull-right[

Is the correlation positive or negative?

--

Do you think it is closer to 0 or -1?

--


```r
cor(state_trump$median_house_inc, state_trump$share_vote_trump)
```

```
## [1] -0.5925995
```

]

---
# Correlation

- Correlation is not causation. It is a necessary condition but not sufficient.

--

- Crime is strongly correlated with ice cream sales.

--

- Many such examples [here](https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations)

---
# Recap

- Difference between descriptive and inferential statistics; sample and population

--

- When presented with descriptive statistics, consider what they say and don't say about the underlying distribution.

--

- When presented with changes in descriptive statistics, consider the different ways the distribution could have changed.

--

- Correlation is a building block of how we explain or predict phenomena in our world using statistics.
