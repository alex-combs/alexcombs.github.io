# Measurement

- **Measurement Validity**: The extent to which a variable measures what it is intended to measure.

- **Measurement Reliability**: The extent to which the measurement process or instrument for a variable generates consistent values.

# In your group, discuss circumstances where the following would have poor measurement validity and/or reliability: 1) A scale in a doctor's office, 2) Pre-tax income as a measure of wealth, and 3) Police response time as a measure of station performance.

# Why does this matter?

- Often leads to important and interesting questions about how data is collected.

- If data have a weak relationship with what you are trying to study, you have a weak foundation upon which to continue your work.

- Sometimes flawed data is all we have, and understanding its flaws can help mitigate mistakes when interpreting and making decisions.
