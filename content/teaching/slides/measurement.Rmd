# Why does this matter?

- Can lead to important questions about how data are collected.

- Can impact our ability to make comparisons between entities or over time that are often involved in decision-making.

- Reminds us not to be too certain. Much of statistics is about producing a *range* of values that *contains* the truth, not producing exact values.
