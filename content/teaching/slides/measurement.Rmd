# What does the data say?

"Data doesn't *say* anything. *Humans* say things. ... Data canâ€™t say anything about an issue any more than a hammer can build a house ... Data is a necessary ingredient in discovery, but you need a human to select it, shape it, and then turn it into an insight. Data is therefore only as useful as its quality and the skills of the person wielding it" (Jones-Rooy, 2019).

# Measurement Validity

- **Measurement Validity**: The extent to which a variable measures what it is intended to measure.

- Are values recorded accurately?

- Do values accurately measure the phenomenon I or others claim they do?

---
# Measurement Reliability

- **Measurement Reliability**: The extent to which the measurement process or instrument for a variable generates consistent values.

- Are values consistent across subjects and/or time?

- Is variation across subjects or time real or due to inconsistent measurement?

# More examples

- Property values

- Crime rates

- Test scores

---
# Why does this matter?

- Can lead to important questions about how data are collected.

- Can impact our ability to make comparisons between entities or over time that are often involved in decision-making.

- One of many reminders not to be too certain. Much of statistics is about producing a *range* of values we trust will usually contain the truth.
