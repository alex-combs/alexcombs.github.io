# Why learn data wrangling

- 80/20 rule

  - About 80% of time on data analysis spent preparing data
  
  - Other 20% spent on actual analysis

- Learning statistics is not as useful if you can't prepare data

- Software like R can save you a lot of time.

---
# Outline

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(gapminder)
library(knitr)
load('labs_files/state_finance_16.RData')
load('labs_files/ga_schdist_raw.RData')
```

- Prelim cleaning
  - rename variables
  - change variable type
- Wrangle verbs
  - extract observations/rows using `filter`
  - extract variables/columns using `select`
  - create or change variables using `mutate`
  - reorder rows using `arrange`
- Preview & report
  - print top or bottom rows using `head` and `tail`
  - combine functions using the pipe operator `%>%`
  - report summary stats using `summarize` and `group_by`

---
# Setup

> **Start a new project named "rlab3".**
  
> **Start a R Markdown document. Keep the setup code chunk at the top but delete the rest of the template. Change echo to FALSE.**

> **Change YAML to:**

```{r, eval=FALSE}
---
title: "RLab3: Data Wrangling"
author: "Your Name"
output:
  html_document:
    df_print: paged
---
```

---
# Setup

- Virtually all wrangling can/should be done with the `tidyverse` package

> **Inside the setup code chunk, load the `tidyverse` package.**

- Note that because the setup code chunk has `include=FALSE` the code *and* output will be suppressed from our export document.

--

> **In same setup code chunk, load these additional packages:**

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(readxl)
library(knitr) # probably need to install this first
library(gapminder)
```

---
# Download & load data

> **Download the `state_finance_16.RData`, `SGF_2016_00A1_with_ann.csv`,  `ga_schdist_raw.RData`, and `ga_schdist_raw.xlsx` files from eLC and add to your project folder**

> **Inside your setup code chunk, load both `.RData` files into R.**

> **If it worked, click on the datasets in your environment pane to view the data.**

- If .RData files do not play nicely, I will soon show code to import the CSV and XLSX files.

---
# Renaming variables

- One of the first things we want to do so the rest of our code is easier to write

--

- Variable names should be as short as possible and most prefer `snake_case_format`

- The names for `state_finance_16` aren't bad because I wrangled them via the import

--

```{r, eval=FALSE}
state_finance_16 <- read_csv("SGF_2016_00A1_with_ann.csv", 
                             col_names = c("id1", "id2", "state", "year",
                                           "finance_type_id", "finance_type",
                                           "finance_source_id", "finance_source",
                                           "amount_1000"), 
                             col_types = "ccciccccn", 
                             na = c("X"), 
                             skip = 2)
```

---
# Preview data

> **Insert a heading, "Raw Data"**

> **In a new code chunk, show the reader the original gapminder data and state finance data using `glimpse`**

> **Name this code chunk `rawdata`**

---
# Renaming a few variables

```{r, eval=FALSE}
data_set <- rename(data_set, 'new_var' = 'old_var', 
                    'new_var' = 'old_var', ...)
```

- Need quotes because telling R to read and write a string of text

--

- Suppose I wanted to rename `id1` to `id_long`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
st_fin <- rename(state_finance_16, 'id_long' = 'id1')
```

---
# Rename skill check

> **In a new code chunk, rename `id2` to `id` in `state_finance_16`. Save the new dataset as `st_fin`.**

--

```{r}
st_fin <- rename(state_finance_16, 'id' = 'id2')
```

> **Re-run the `glimpse` command above to see if `rename` worked as expected.**

--

- What's wrong?

--

> **Start a new line inside this code chunk and use `glimpse` on the `st_fin` dataset. Add the option that suppresses code and output.**

---
# Renaming many variables

> **Inside the `rawdata` code chunk, show the reader the original `ga_schdist_raw` data using `glimpse`. This will only work if you were able to load the `.RData` file.**

> **Knit to HTML so we can see what our document looks like so far.**

- The `ga_schdist_raw` data has many variables needing renamed.

---
# Renaming many variables

- There is a way to efficiently rename many variables after import, but I recommend renaming via import.

> **In a new code chunk, copy & paste below code and run**

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ga_schdist_raw <- read_xlsx("ga_schdist_raw.xlsx", 
                            range = "A8:I231",
                            col_names = c("district", "state",
                                           "charter", "enroll",
                                           "lep", "sped", "frpl",
                                           "white",
                                           "expenditures"))
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
ga_schdist_raw <- read_xlsx("labs_files/ga_schdist_raw.xlsx", 
                            range = "A8:I231",
                            col_names = c("district", "state",
                                           "charter", "enroll",
                                           "lep", "sped", "frpl",
                                           "white",
                                           "expenditures"))
#save(ga_schdist_raw, file = 'ga_schdist_raw.RData')
```

---
# Order of operations

> **Re-run the `glimpse(ga_schdist_raw)` line in the `rawdata` code chunk.**

- Note that the output includes the new variable names.

--

> **Knit to HTML.**

--

- Note that the output includes the old variable names.

- Why the difference?

---
# Converting variable types

- We can overwrite how R stores variables within a dataset

- General syntax:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
data_set$variable <- as.newtype(data_set$variable)
#where newtype is the type you want
```

--

- Basic variable type options:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
as.numeric()
as.character() #text
as.integer()
as.factor() #categorical
as.logical() # converts binary (dummy) variables to True/False
```

---
# Converting variable types

- From glimpsing the data, we see that `st_fin$state` is stored as a character/text variable

- Suppose we want R to recognize it as a categorical variable

> **In the code chunk where we created `st_fin`, start a new line and convert `st_fin$state` from text to categorical.**

--

```{r}
st_fin$state <- as.factor(st_fin$state)
```

> **Re-run `glimpse(st_fin)` to check if it worked.**

---
# Skill check

- Let's create a copy of `ga_schdist_raw` that we will wrangle moving forward.

> **In a new code chunk, copy&paste below code and run. Use option to suppress any output.**

```{r}
ga_schdist <- ga_schdist_raw
```

--

- Several variables in `ga_schdist` stored as text need converted to numeric

> **In the code chunk you just created, identify which variables should be numeric and convert them. This gets repetitive...copy&paste is your friend.**

---
# Answer

```{r, warning=FALSE}
ga_schdist$enroll <- as.numeric(ga_schdist$enroll)
ga_schdist$lep <- as.numeric(ga_schdist$lep)
ga_schdist$sped <- as.numeric(ga_schdist$sped)
ga_schdist$frpl <- as.numeric(ga_schdist$frpl)
ga_schdist$white <- as.numeric(ga_schdist$white)
ga_schdist$expenditures <- as.numeric(ga_schdist$expenditures)
```

--

- There are more efficient ways to do this, but we won't need to convert more than a few variables at a time in this course.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ga_schdist <- mutate(ga_schdist, 
                     across(c('enroll':'expenditures'), as.numeric))
```

# Wrangle verbs

---
# Process

- Brief review of each verb then practice using `gapminder`

```{r, echo=FALSE}
gapminder %>% 
  slice_sample(n=1) %>% 
  kable(digits = 1)
```

- Continent & year

```{r}
levels(gapminder$continent)
unique(gapminder$year)
```

---
# Filter

![](labs_files/filter.png)

- General syntax:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
filter(data_set, criteria) #prints the result
filtered_data_set <- filter(data_set, criteria) #saves result
(filtered_data_set <- filter(data_set, criteria)) #saves & prints result
```

---
# Filter example

Keep all 2007 observations

```{r, results='hide'}
filter(gapminder, year == 2007)
```

Keep all Africa observations

```{r, results='hide'}
filter(gapminder, continent == 'Africa')
```

---
# Filter practice

> **Start a new code chunk and name it filter. Set option to suppress code and output.**

> **Keep all Oceania observations**

> **Keep all 1952 observations**

---
# Conditional and logical operators

- Often want to filter on multiple criteria

- Conditionals
  - "If equal to" `==`
  - "If not equal to" `!=`
  - "If greater than, less than, or equal to" `>, <, >=, <=`

- Logicals
  - "And" `&`
  - "Or" `|`

---
# Filter examples

Keep all Africa observations in 2007

```{r, results='hide'}
filter(gapminder, continent == 'Africa' & year == 2007)
```

Keep Africa and Oceania

```{r, results='hide'}
filter(gapminder, continent == 'Africa' | continent == 'Oceania')
```

Keep Africa and Oceania after 1992

```{r, results='hide'}
filter(gapminder, (continent == 'Africa' | continent == 'Oceania') & year > 1992)
```

Remove Oceania and keep 1992 or later

```{r, results='hide'}
filter(gapminder, continent != 'Oceania' & year >= 1992)
```

---
# Filter practice

> **Keep Americas in 1952**

> **Keep Europe and Asia and remove 1952**

---
# Select

![](labs_files/select.png)

- General syntax

```{r, eval=FALSE}
new_dataset <- select(old_dataset, var1, var2, var3, ...)
# where var is the name of the variable you want to keep
```

- Or to drop variables

```{r, eval=FALSE}
new_dataset <- select(old_dataset, -var1, -var2, ...)
```

- Whichever requires the shorter list of names

---
# Select examples

Keep country, year, and life expectancy

```{r, results='hide'}
select(gapminder, country, year, lifeExp)
```

Remove population

```{r, results='hide'}
select(gapminder, -pop)
```

---
# Select practice

> **Start a new code chunk and name it select. Set option to suppress code and output.**

> **Keep country, year, and population**

> **Keep country, year, population, life expectancy, and GDP per capita**

---
# Subsetting

- `filter` & `select` are intelligent functions that keep/remove rows and columns because they work off of criteria

- **Subsetting** is a naive way to keep/remove rows and columns because it works off of numbered positions of the dataset (e.g. first row or last column)

- Sometimes we want to keep or remove a certain row or column

---
# Subsetting

- General syntax

```{r, eval=FALSE}
new_dataset <- dataset[row number(s) to keep or remove, 
                   column number(s) to keep or remove]

new_dataset <- dataset[5, 2]
# would keep only the 5th row and 2nd column

new_dataset <- dataset[-5, -2]
# would drop 5th row and 2nd column

new_dataset <- dataset[c(-3,-5), c(1:10)]
# would drop 3rd and 5th rows, and keep columns 1-10
```

---
# Subsetting examples

Suppose I want to show first six rows of `gapminder`

```{r, results='hide'}
gapminder[c(1:6),]
```

Remove top row and last column

```{r, eval=FALSE}
gapminder_clean <- gapminder[-1, -6]
```

---
# Subsetting practice

> **Start a new code chunk and name it subset. Set option to suppress code and output.**

> **Keep only first row and all columns**

> **Remove first, ninth, and thirteenth rows, keep columns 1-4**

---
# Mutate

![](labs_files/mutate.png)

- General syntax

```{r, eval=FALSE}
dataset <- mutate(dataset, new_var = whatever)
```

- Only a single `=` is used because we are assigning value

- If `new_var` is the name of an existing variable, `mutate` will overwrite it according to your equation

- Otherwise, `mutate` will add a new variable

---
# Mutate examples

Change population from ones to millions

```{r, results='hide'}
mutate(gapminder, pop = pop/1000000)
```

Create new population variable expressed in millions

```{r, results='hide'}
mutate(gapminder, pop_millions = pop/1000000)
```

Create variable equal to global, all-time life expectancy

```{r, eval=FALSE}
gapminder2 <- mutate(gapminder, 
                     avg_lifeExp = mean(lifeExp))
```

---
# Mutate examples

Create variable equal to how much above/below country is from `avg_lifeExp`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
gapminder3 <- mutate(gapminder2, 
                     deviation_lifeExp = lifeExp - avg_lifeExp)
#or
gapminder3 <- mutate(gapminder, 
                     deviation_lifeExp = lifeExp - mean(lifeExp))
```

Can create multiple variables at a time

```{r, eval=FALSE}
gapminder3 <- mutate(gapminder,
                     pop_millions = pop/1000000,
                     avg_lifeExp = mean(lifeExp),
                     deviation_lifeExp = lifeExp - avg_lifeExp)
```

---
# Mutate practice

> **Start a new code chunk and name it mutate. Set option to suppress code and output.**

> **Create a new dataset `gapminder2` that contains only the year 2007**

> **Next, create a new variable `gdp` equal to each country's GDP**

> **Next, create a new variable `global_gdp` equal to the sum of all GDPs. The `sum()` function adds all values it is given.**

> **Lastly, create a new variable `pct_global_gdp` equal to each country's percent of global GDP.**

---
# Arrange

![](labs_files/arrange.png)

- General syntax

```{r, eval=FALSE}
arrange(data_set, var)
# Where var is the variable on which you want to arrange
# Arranges in ascending order by default

arrange(data_set, desc(var))
# Arranges in descending order
```

- Usually doesn't make sense to create a new dataset with `arrange` but helpful for printing tables to see highest or lowest cases

---
# Arrange examples

Arrange countries in ascending order of life expectancy (lowest-to-highest)

```{r, results='hide'}
arrange(gapminder, lifeExp)
```

Arrange countries in descending order of life expectancy (highest-to-lowest)

```{r, results='hide'}
arrange(gapminder, desc(lifeExp))
```

---
# Arrange practice

> **Start a new code chunk and name it arrange. Set option to suppress code and output.**

> **Rearrange your `gapminder2` dataset so the countries with the highest percent of global gdp are at the top.**

> **Which country had the highest percent of global GDP as of 2007? What was the percent?**

# Combining Wrangle Verbs

---
# Pipe operator `%>%`

- Allows us to run multiple commands, sequentially feeding the result of the previous line of code to the next

- Makes code easier to read and write

- Keyboard shortcut is Cmd+Shift+M

---
# Pipe example

Suppose I wanted to provide a table of the top five countries with respect to percent of global GDP in 2007. Without piping:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
gapminder2 <- filter(gapminder, year == 2007)

gapminder2 <- mutate(gapminder2, 
                     gdp = gdpPercap*pop,
                     global_gdp = sum(gdp),
                     pct_global_gdp = (gdp/global_gdp)*100)

gdp_table <- select(gapminder2, country, pct_global_gdp)
gdp_table <- arrange(gdp_table, desc(pct_global_gdp))

head(gdp_table, n = 5)
```

---
# Pipe example

Provide a table of the top five countries with respect to percent of global GDP in 2007 with piping:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  mutate(gdp = gdpPercap*pop,
         global_gdp = sum(gdp),
         pct_global_gdp = (gdp/global_gdp)*100) %>% 
  select(country, pct_global_gdp) %>% 
  arrange(desc(pct_global_gdp)) %>% 
  head(n=5)
```

- Don't have to keep specifying the dataset inside each verb

- Don't have to save the result each step of the way

- Easier to follow (at least for most)

---
# Pipe practice

> **Add a heading "Wrangling", then a lower-level heading "Gapminder"**

> **Start a new code chunk and name it pipe. Don't suppress output.**

> **Copy&paste the code from the mutate code chunk that created `gapminder2` without piping.**

> **Convert this code to a single pipe that now saves a `gapminder3` dataset that is identical except for year 1952 instead of 2007.**

> **On a new line, use the pipe operator to take `gapminder3`, keep only country and percent of global GDP, and provide a table of the five countries with the highest percentages.**

---
# Answer

```{r, eval=FALSE}
gapminder2 <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 1952) %>% 
  mutate(gdp = gdpPercap*pop,
         global_gdp = sum(gdp),
         pct_global_gdp = (gdp/global_gdp)*100)

gapminder2 %>% 
  select(country, pct_global_gdp) %>% 
  arrange(desc(pct_global_gdp)) %>% 
  head(n=5)
```

---
# Check output

> **Knit to HTML**

--

- There are ways to preview data that look nicer than `glimpse` but let's not worry about that right now.

- Let's try to make this GDP table appropriate for external audience

---
# Kable options for tables

- The `kable()` function, part of the `knitr` package, is a quick way to format tables.

- Three particularly useful options:
  - digits = # sets the number of digits to the right of the decimal
  - col.names = renames the columns
  - caption = provides a table title

---
# Kable example

> **Start a new code chunk and name it kable. Copy&paste below code.**

```{r, eval=FALSE}
gapminder2 %>% 
  select(country, pct_global_gdp) %>% 
  arrange(desc(pct_global_gdp)) %>% 
  head(n=5) %>% 
  kable(digits = 1, 
        col.names = c('Country', 'Percent of Global GDP'), 
        caption = 'Largest Economies in 1952')
```

# Summarize & Group By

---
# Summarize

![](labs_files/summarize.png)

- General syntax

```{r, eval=FALSE}
summarize(data_set, name of column = function(variable),
          name of column = function(variable),...)
```

- Where `function` is one of many possible summary functions (see data transformation cheatsheet)

- Useful for quickly reporting a few summary stats in a nicely formatted table

---
# Summarize example

Report median life expectancy and GDP per capita in 2007

```{r, eval=FALSE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  summarize('Median Life Expectancy' = median(lifeExp),
            'Median GDP per Capita' = median(gdpPercap)) %>% 
  kable(digits = 0,
        format.args = list(big.mark = ','))
```

---
# Summarize practice

> **Start a new code chunk and name it summarize. Don't suppress output.**

> **Produce a table that reports the `min`imum, `median`, and `max`imum percentages of global GDP in 1952.**

---
# Group By

![](labs_files/group_by.png)

- General syntax

```{r, eval=FALSE}
data_set %>% 
  group_by(grouping_variable) %>% 
  summarize(name = function(variable))
```

- Year and any nominal variable are common grouping variables

---
# Group by example

Report median life expectancy and GDP per capita in 2007 *by continent*

```{r, eval=FALSE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize('Median Life Expectancy' = median(lifeExp),
            'Median GDP per Capita' = median(gdpPercap)) %>% 
  kable(digits = 0,
        format.args = list(big.mark = ','))
```

---
# Group by practice

> **Start a new code chunk and name it groupby. Don't suppress output.**

> **Produce a table that reports the `min`imum, `median`, and `max`imum percentages of global GDP by year.**
